Hello,
I have created Candor, an anonymous Idea Rater.  The idea portion is fluid and working, and I have been tested with the Rating Create view, as I have attempted for hours and hours to
solve the issue where the Rating Create was throwing a null exception.  I attempted just about every modification over and over and I am still going through it in debugging mode.  I would
love to see this issue approached by anyone else.  The buttons are all there and functionality crashes at the rating create.  I will continue to pursue this, as I have yet to ask anyone
for help.  That being said I have yet to share this issue with other classmates.  I am open to new ways of approaching this issue.  Thank you for your reflections on this issue, I wish only to learn.
