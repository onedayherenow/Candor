So for us here on earth what they will do is they will take representatives from every country, 
they will take members of the animal kingdom the sea kingdom the insect kingdom the wildlife kingdom of everything 
and what they will do is they will take us and transport us in starships to a place where they will in fact hold these ceremonies 
and the planet earth and its representatives with all of its life forms at least several representations will be paraded 
and introduced to these other star nations. This process can take up to a year and then everyone is brought back.
Now what you're going to find out in this process or what the kids, our kids are going to find out in this process is that many of the
life forms we have here they already exist in other star planets and other solar systems, 
many of them were brought here and what happens was they would alter their dna in order to see if they could survive in this ecosystem, 
earth is a very complex ecosystem and a lot of that work was done on uranus and on neptune. 
Now isn't it interesting that these are two water planets that are at the edge of our solar system and that water's never frozen 
in fact seasonally you can see green algae growing on neptune, okay our satellites have seen this and you know NASA 
just doesn't know what to say so they say nothing they just in fact ignore it, so there is life everywhere.
