Stacy Ambler,

I am writing to you to ask you to please forgive my circumstance of my expressing my wish to contribute to you financially 
and my ignorance of what is considered unethical which to me would seem normal that, I didnt know the status of public defendant was
unchangeable in that way as no one ever told me.

I don't know what to do at this point other than write you and I want this for you to not to be just another case of 
an anonymous criminal for you and to give you some background about who I am.
I was born to a humble South American immigrant family.  
As a child I drew while the children played.
My parents are a great influence as they always encouraged me.
At 10, I started playing guitar.
At 17 I read emerald tablets of Thoth and then shortly after this had my first lucid dream, started painting, and began my sitting meditation practice.
In 2014 at 19 I came into contact with Nassin Harameins work and fell in love with unified physics.
I would paint while listening physics on and on and on!
I lived in Austria from 2015-2016 to study painting at the Vienna Academy of Visionary Art aka 'VAVA'.
The paintings im sharing here are from around that time.
When I got back from vienna I realized I needed a website, and so
2017 is when I began learning diving into programming/web-architecture,
also is when I was introduced to the pleiadians (book" 'The Pleiadian Workbook") by another human/"terran" which awoke something in me I'm sure you can relate.
I began to sometimes interact or receive information in meditations from beings or a being.
In 2018 I began hosting workshops at music art festivals about intuition and emotional intelligence.
2019 I came into contact with Wim hofs breathing technique and cold water exposure which is now a part of daily living.
Throughout these years one of the constants in my life was my continued romance with physics as a muse,, wherever I was I could always find time to tune in to a unified physics recording asI would listen I'd follow along in my mind and visualize the mechanics of flow of information/energy that was being discussed.
I studied Nassims work for 8 years before I met Dans.
In 2022 , I FINALLY! came into contact with Dan's work (where'v you been all my life??), and a combination of experiences, my sister's passing, a romantic heartbreak, and Dan's work 'clicking' the conceptual foundations of physics I had accumulated over the years all into place,
for lack of better words I popped, as in had my first experiences with the nectar that is released through the upperback of the mouth during intense emotional meditation/kundalini like experiences.
Since then, I devour Dan's work in Love, and in hope that I may be able to help others in the way that this has helped me.
I am seeking to gain courage to, as Dan would say, 'turn myself inside out' to the world, and write and or make videos about all this.
I have great affinity and love for Hindu vedic traditions and for regarding source as a feminine motherly embodiment.
I speak english and spanish.
The gratitude and joy I feel knowing the intentions behind this group and that you all carry with you into here is overflowing.
I love you all!
Thank you Jen for holding space for us and making us feel welcome to open ♡♡♡
