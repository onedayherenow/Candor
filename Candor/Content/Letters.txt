Stacy Ambler,

I am writing to you to ask you to please forgive my circumstance of my expressing my wish to contribute to you financially 
and my ignorance of what is considered unethical which to me would seem normal, I didnt know the status of public defendant was
unchangeable in that way as no one ever told me.

I don't know what to do at this point other than write you and be open to you. I want this for you to not to be just another case of 
an anonymous criminal for you and to give you background about who I am.

I was born to a humble South American immigrant family.   
My parents are a great influence as they always encouraged me.
As a child I drew while the children played.
At 17 I started painting as a way to connect with the spirit of who I was as a child.
Right after high school, I worked from 2013 to 2015 at a restaurant to save up money to move to
Vienna, Austria in 2015-2016 where I studied painting at the Vienna Academy of Visionary Art aka 'VAVA'.
The paintings im sharing here are from around that time.
When I got back from vienna a close friend passed after which I fell into a 
deep depression and got my first owi.
2017 is when my mom Angela Zuluaga was diagnosed with alzheimers. 
In 2018 I went back to school for computer science, as a way to learn to make websites for my art.
2019 I got my second owi jan.  
2022 was one of the most difficult years of my life.  My sister Angelica Zuluaga passed away from asthma attack
and I fell into a deep depression that turned out to be another owi for me.  

Stacy I'm not a criminal.  I'm an artist who has used alcohol to cope in the past and suffered by that self sabotage in doing so, 
however let me tell you I have not had a sip of alcohol this year. 
The gratitude and joy I feel knowing the intentions behind this group and that you all carry with you into here is overflowing.
Thank you for holding space for us and making us feel welcome to open ♡♡♡
