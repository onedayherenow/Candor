Stacy Ambler,

I am writing to you to ask you to please forgive my circumstance of my expressing my wish to contribute to you financially 
and my ignorance of what is considered unethical which to me would seem normal that, I didnt know the status of public defendant was
unchangeable in that way as no one ever told me.

I don't know what to do at this point other than write you and I want this for you to not to be just another case of 
an anonymous criminal for you and to give you some background about who I am.
I was born to a South American family
