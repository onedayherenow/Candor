VI. The Spiritual Nature of Phase (PhaseLocking)



In our inquiry into the nature of Waves we start with:
As everything in the universe is One plasma medium superfluid, this One Substance some call Akasha, Ether,
takes the form, shape, and behavior of what we call waves. 

These waves, like all energy, adhere to energetic principles of frequency, spin-rate, and energy levels.

These wave collectively all behave in toroidal dynamics; 
That is, 
the flow-path and shapes of these waves are primarily in phase-discipline with the geometry of a torus.

Why a torus?  A torus has all the vector possibilities for waves to flow inwards (gravitation),
flow outwards (electromagnetism), 
and as well to flow in spinning spirals of centripetal rotation (mass), 
thus conserving inertia (energy).

This study of the nature of waves is precisely what we call wave-mechanics.

We are going to meditate here now upon an aspect of wave-mechanics called the "phase"/"phasing" of a wave,
to acquire some insight 'inner sight' related to waves along with what it means for a wave to "phase-embed",
"phase-lock", "phase-shift", and as well what we refer to when we talk about the "phase-discipline" of a wave
or any arbitrary system.


I.) PHASES
I.a.) What are Phases?
We can summarize what a wave phase is by saying it is the current place and 'timing' of a wave along it's rhythmical 
life-cycle path. 
	To develop an intuitive feel for what a wave phase is, lets look at a few tangible examples.

'Playing Music'
FEEL(EXPERIENTIAL) - Imagine you are musician.  Surely some of you are, however all of you have heard music (hopefully?!).
Now imagine you are sitting down in a chair with your instrument in a hallway between three rooms.
In each of the three rooms, there is a different musical band playing.
In each of the three rooms, each seperate band is playing at their own different tempo, different tuning, different keys,
and different songs.  
All bands are playing at the same time, except they cannot hear each other, but you CAN while sitting in the hallway.
You hear all three bands at the same time.
	
Remember, all music is waves, compression waves.
Therefore a musical song is a wave life-cycle.

Phases are wave life-cycles; More specifically, the phase of a wave refers to where the waves currently are at in 
their respective wave life-cycle, both literally in time/space coordinates and as well energetically in terms of
qualitative wave properties.  
Wave life-cycles have all of the normal properties of waves such as frequency,
intensity/amplification, and rate of speed/spin.  
	
So in this example above, 
each of the three respective whole bands that are playing are each, three unique phases. 

Yes each musician in each band is a phase too, and so we say each musician is 'phase-locked' with each other,
and as a collective they are phase-locked into the grand overall unifying 'phase' of the band as a whole.

However if all the musicians in one of the bands in one room all are playing at different points of the song,
beginning, middle, end  -At the same time-, then we say they are "out of phase".
(simultaneously if someone is at the beginning, someone is playing at the middle, someone is playing the ending,
all in same band this would be clearly out of phase)

In our example,
as we are in the hallways listening to these three bands/phases play at once, what if we start to play our
instrument in the hallway along to, and in the same key, tempo, and tuning as one specific band out of the three?
You would be correct in saying that you have 'phase-locked' into their band's 'phase'.

For musicians, from experience I can say this moment of phase-locking with other musicians in a song is a very real 
distinct feeling that literally feels like you are locking into a very specific set of tempo, rythmic, and tuning 
conditions that all form a 'wave' that you as the musician are trying to, like a surfer, first 
'catch' (phase-shift into) the wave and then, 'surf' 
(now once phase-locked in, playing music in that song
aka channeling-consciousness-in-accordance-to-the-phase-discipline-one-is-in)


What if now,
as a musician in the hallway playing along to one of the bands, we change and switch from that band to 
instead now start playing along with another one of the other two distinct bands?

If we switch our playing from playing along with one band to playing with another, this is what 








IMAGINE(VISUALIZE) - Imagine two seperate flocks of distinct species of birds we will call Species.A.and 
Species.B.
Imagine Species.A. flies in a flock across the continent and back each year. 
Now imagine Species.B. doesnt flock across the continent, they only mostly stay in one area.
Now imagine that once every year, Species.A. crosses paths with Species.B. 

Now lets say each and every bird in both Species.A. and Species.B. flocks represents a 'wave'.
Okay good, the stage is set.
To innerstand "phase", "phase-lock", and "phase-shift" lets see in our example where are the phases, where do
they lock, and where do they shift?

Species.A.'s flight travel path is a phase.  So is Species.B's.

When either Species.A. or Species.B flies in a tight synchronized formation, 
like the kind you see performed by military jet-planes or by a beehive swarming around the Queen Bee, 
we say those birds/waves have 'phase-locked' together.

When these two flocks cross each other's path, if a bird from Species.A. seperates and flies off with the
Species.B. flock, we say it has 'phase-shifted'.  

Also when a bird in Species.A. or B. breaks away from the 'tight formation' flight path of the birds and begins to
do it's own flight path, albeit still part of the same flock if it breaks away from or breaks into the 
leading tight formation (like we see in military jet planes as mentioned above), 
then we also say it has 'phase-shifted'.


III.) Phase-Locking
III.a.) What is Phase-locking

Three conceptually helpful real examples to intuit phaselocking are that of lightning bugs, metronomes, 
and the female menstrual cycles. 

'Fireflies / Lightning Bugs'
THINK(Experiential) - "Fireflies" or "Lightning bugs" (their real name escapes me and lightning bugs is more fun) 
are a specific kind of insect

'Metronomes'
THINK(Experiential) - Metronomes as we know are a device with a pendulum that swings back and forth, back and forth
with a 'click' sound every time it swings 'back' and 'forth' and it sounds like this:  'tick' 'tick' 'tick' tick' 'tick'.
The metronome marks time with it's clicking and this is what it is used for.
What happens if we put a bunch of metronomes in


*Menstrual Cycles*
THINK(Experiential) -  It is reportedly common for women who live together and/or spend much time together near daily to 
'phaselock' menstrual cycles with each other so that, although they may initially had their menstrual cycles at
seperate different times of the month, after so long of sharing space and intertwining their plasmic-aura bio-fields
with each other they eventually phase-lock menstrual cycles and start to have their period at the same times as each other.


Now that we innerstand some common everyday examples of phases and phaselocking,
lets dig into the fundamental principles of the wave-mechanics at play
---How and why does phases and phaselocking occur in the flow dynamics of universal Torus-structure plasma systems? 



III.b.) Why, when and how does phase-locking occur?


(The why illuminates the when and how)
"Why?" - Phaselocking waves together into a single phase is one of the most natural functions of the universe because
phaselocking is how the universe and all systems in it conserve inertia / energy / charge.
That is, 
Phase-locking together with Phase-embedding is one of the main ways in which the Universe or any systems or
sub-systems in general conserve inertia.  By conserving inertia we mean conserving plasma, energy, or by 
definition conserving the ability to do work.
	
"When" - A wave phase-locks in together with another wave's phase or with the phase of a collective group of waves when
it's phase inhabits the same magnetic and/or plasma field throughout-which another wave phase or phases group is flowing
through in constant uniformity.  
Constant uniformity is another word for fractal, or self-symmetry.
All waves of energy/magnetism/ether flow towards fractal systems.
Therefore, waves tend to phase-lock to the most self-symmetrical fractal system nearby in terms of geometry,
as this is what will allow the wave to retain it's greatest amount of inertia,
Whether it's a metronome phase-locking to a collective group of metronomes, a woman phase-locking with another
woman, a firefly phase-locking to a collective group of fireflies, 
BECAUSE
It is easier energetically for a wave to follow the phase of a larger field within which it is embedded than to 
pursue it's own independant phase (wave life-cycle).

(It's also easier to follow what others are doing instead of making our own decisions for our own life path)


"How?" - Phase-lock occurs when the energetic qualities of a wave suddenly 'locks in' and tunes energetically in phase 
	to match the energetic qualities and phase of another wave or a larger collection of waves nearby.
	
	This is equivalent to a street parade or military march how they all march in phase.



III.b.a.) - Phase-locking to natural systems vs artificial systems and institutions





---Now what does phases and phaselocking have to do with fractality and geometry?
(hint: constructive vs destructive wave interference)



---What does phases and phaselocking have to do with reported 'synchronicity' 
(Synchronicity as in the experience of external events coinciding with mirroring our internal world in a 
personally meaningful way:  
For example just when you are beginning to write a book about physics, you go to see one of your favorite musicians
in concert, and right beside you you 'synchronistically' spontaneously meet an older fellow who, come to find out is a
physicist and mathematician (out of all possibiilities) with whom you have an intensely meaningful conversation with
and is interested in looking over your writings via email)

********( PHASES:  ENTANGLEMENT : PHASELOCKING ACROSS SCALES VIA PHI / GOLDEN-RATIO)*******







	Phi/golden-ratio is the ratio phase discipline among waves which phase-locks always with each other across all scales. 
As phased race as phi golden ratio is the ratio in which small waves embed into large waves fractally infinitely. 
Model three dimensionally a dodecahedron and icosahedron embedded within each other repeating to infinity the dodecahedron

represents the Phi golden ratio with phase discipline geometry 
and the icosahedron represents the Isotropic vector matrix which is the hexagonal

Double tetrahedron
which is the exact merkaba tetrahedrons 
and they embed within each other now fate the five golden ratio is also the ratio which face locks the brain with the breathing with the heart and now, 
this leads to with developing ether technology we build the technology in such a way that it obeys Phi / Golden-Ratio way harmonic wave geometry 
in its architectural and material and geometric properties and we can also think of the zero points or either technology generating device 
as a body as a body has a heart brain and nervous system

different systems as well as systems to output,
and where systems output is where the symmetry is broken with the whole like the mouth or the ears

we can output and extract energy or information from inside this from within. 

Symmetry is where we can extract energy so, how do we look receiver for that energy questions we can proceed now with evolution and evolution of a system 

oh we are thinking about neural networks and a machine learning AI program that is learning and we use that example. 
Then we mentioned that humans is not limited to anything at all is not limited and so, okay. 

So our code data information that we're being fed with build our neural networks and evolve what

data receive this attention and attention is intimately linked with meditation and the practice of directing one's focus to whatever point or scope one

and. What what happens is between associated information we begin to build connections and those connections are highways for information transfer. 
Those are new rivers highway paths for information transfer, new lines, vector lines, for chart for charge geometry new lines and the geometry and the geometry of the snowflake.


The beauty of learning a subject or learning in general, from many different angles one once fractal geometry

once geometry begins to connect, and be fractal and it all connects and becomes one.

For example,
For years the different angles of experience in my consciousness remained fractionated, isolated, from each other

Imagine a hexagon

And so each fractionation took on
was an oil painter, a musician, a linguist, a software developer,

becomes a fractal thought form it can become a black hole in itself.




Tetra octacube dodeca icosa is the inverse implosion order for the nest of platonic solids,
The tetra octa cube cannot make it in the dodeca icosa without abiding by golden ratio (stellation? )
A profound yet ever present philosophical point regarding abiding In Love,
And In Love we connect with and 'exchange inertia' and talk to and work and play with the larger and smaller scales...
We are the tetra octa cube (h2o) and Gaia and galaxy and atom is dodeca icosa


The geometry of the nucleus is dodeca. 21st century mag

And can be thought of as a kind of plasmic electromagnetic aura surrounding anything with mass,
Just like anything with mass also has accompanying it a gravitational scalar/longitudinal aspect/force

Q&A
Waves

The Meridians as Nervous system as Rivers for Flow of Voltage Prana 
Brainwaves
Heartwaves
What are brainwaves?
What do brainwaves have to do with physics?
	The body as a motor radio computer antennae
How are brainwaves correlated to the acquisition of prana? 
	(Golden Ratio in brainwaves enables the reccursion of self-embedding)
Unconcious vs Conscious Brainwave Production
	Brainwaves and 'weights'
		'Weights' are essentially pressure.  When we say we 'lift weights' we are practicing 
		deliberately to elicit the compressing and contracting voltage through our body by focused intention.
		That is, 
		when we say we lift a weight, we are saying that we compressed through our body's muscles the equivalent of 
		voltage / pressure equal-to-or-greater-than to the voltage / pressure of the weight, 
		inducing a current to flow through the 'muscle' which we are using to compress the weights, 
		thus inducing prana / chi / mana to flow into that muscle.
		There is energy stored in that muscle like a crystal.  When we say that the muscle is repairing we say
		that the muscle is crystallizing.  When we say we are exercising our muscle by lifting weights,
		we are in turn liquifying or 'changing wave-phase' of the inertia stored in the muscle from that of 
		a crystalline state to that of a liquid-like fluid-dynamic electrical-state of flow of the inertia that 
		had been stored as a crystal.
		As the inertia in the muscles of the body is crystallizing, 
		fitness trainers may call this anabolism or an 'anabolic state'.
		As the inertia in the muscles is 'melted' through the thermodynamic effects of exercise and 'freed' to be used
		as flow for mechanical and electrical inertia, fitness trainers may call this process in the body 'catabolism'.  


Brainwaves essentially are fluxes of electromagnetic pressure being generated in, and flowing through, the brain.
These brainwaves, along with the heart, act as a kind of tuner for the perception and reception of information 
processing, acting as a kind of determinate filter for human cognitive perception.



What do brainwaves have to do with physics and the discussion of universal oneness?

"Brainwave Exercise | Brainwave Evolution"
THINK(Metaphor)
	To illustrate in fine ink how brainwaves are intimately related to our investigation of universal oneness,
consider the recoccuring metaphors that we like to keep handy and enjoy using of: 
1. The body as a radio
2. The body as an electrical motor-engine
3. The body as an evolving fractal system

	-Here now we blend these three analogies into one model-

The body as a "free energy" Zero-Point-Energy device
As the body is functionally literally equivalent to a radio, motor-engine, and evolving fractal system,
we innerstand now this:

"Heartbeat and Egg Fertilization"
IMAGINE(Experiential)
For new life to begin fertilized electrically in the egg in a female's womb from the male's sperm, 
just like paramedics when they revive someone's heartbeat through electric shock of the heart in the chest,
one needs an electric spark to flow across a 'spark gap' between two conductors, from one to the other
to 'turn on' or 'activate' the motor-engine in the second conductor: 
which, in this case would be the heart beating back to life or the egg incubated and alive with voltage 
to grow into a fetus/embyro.
This spark is generated only when the voltage flowing from one conductor to the next exceeds the rate of 
voltage loss in the spark gap between the two conductors.  Truly the gap only turns into a 'spark gap' if the
first conductor's voltage current exceeds the quantity lost in the gap.

What does this have to do with brainwaves, prana/energy, and evolution?

Continuing now, with our prior examples we can innerstand a few concepts:
First,

we see that, 
to activate a new system or to activate new "paths for electrical currents to flow", 
we first require 
-an 'initial' flow-,
a first conductor of electrical current with voltage equal to or greater than the voltage required to initialize and
activate the autonomous flow of the second conductor.. 
This second conductor is activated because the flow of the first conductor exceeds the resistance of the
second conductor.
Therefore, the first conductor is the inducer, and induction is what is happening to the second conductor beginning to
generate it's own voltage again.
More specifically this induction process is a flow of free electrons also known as an 'electron cloud' or 'charge cloud' 
that is permissibly beginning to circulate throughout the second conductor.
This in turn produces a new electromagnetic field radiating outward from and permeating this second conductor's "body", 
surrounding it as well.
Thus, the second conductor is now electrically and magnetically active with it's own respective field in it's own right
and able to perform operations according to it's inherit programmed electrical chemical and mechanical functions.

This field can become bio-active if the material constituting it are of biologic nature along with minerals and water.

THIS IS PROFOUNDLY SPIRITUAL AND PHILISOPHICAL

How come?

Take the Holy Spirit or Kundalini for example.  It is widely recorded that experiences of 'mystical union'
with the Holy Spirit and as well, experiences of Kundalini awakening are like a spark or a candle in which,
once a being is in this state -which has a particular electromagnetic frequency signatures respective to the state itself-
this state becomes then permissibly transferrable to another nearby system or 'capacitor' or human or 
'electrical-motor-engine' 
AS LONG AS
the nearby system / 'capacitor' / human / 'electrical-motor-engine' / antennae can withold the voltage long enough
to learn how to sustain it.

What do we mean by sustain it?

We say sustain it because in order for a system to continue to generate electromagnetic force over time we need to
make a kind of 'temple',
in other words we need a body made up of the kind of frequencies and materials aka chemical compositions that can 
withstand the kind of voltage we are seeking to conduct through it.  
If we would like

How do we sustain it?  The voltage can be sustained AS LONG AS the material with which the second conductor is
built is a high dielectric material and used in phi golden-ratio proportions

electrically contagious is what Dan Winter might say,

and this we call inductance (el anuncio para la familia) in electrical engineering.


Inductance is when a Second electrical generative force flow is created from a first initial flowing electrical generative
force.  The second flow is generated in correlation to it's magnetic field.

"Ratios and Relationships"
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
********| Ratios | Relationships | *******


Ratio, 
	Ratio, 
		Ratio.

To continue the sincerity of our investigation of the spiritual nature of the natural world, 
I will say now the subject of ratio is a hot esoteric philosophical gateway to other topics such as
Fractality,
		Love and all the Emotions,
			Music,
				Gravity			

Ratios are a great key lesson full of meaning and importance whenever they are found in any natural system

Remember ratios look like:
2/3, 5/4, 1/137, 2.618/1 etc 

We've all heard the word ratio and seen them used but how is this word universally related to every single one of our experiences and interactions?
To physics?  And the spiritual and philosophical implications?

There is a simple equivalence that can be revealed regarding ratios in our natural world and that is this:

"Ratio" = "Relationship" 

Before we go any further, we are in need of addressing a monumental importancy and key cornerstone subject in our 
spiritual realization of the universal oneness of physics,
and that is 
the subject of
-Relationships-
...more precisely this is the subject of -Ratio-
and we mean to introduce Relationships vs. Ratios now together as inter-changeable words, 
and we shall see why as we follow along here

To show simply and easy the equivalence of "Ratio" = "Relationship"
We illustrate now with these two real-world examples:

The first is for 'feelers' (regarding emotion felt in music)
The second example is for 'thinkers' (regarding the electron-cloud)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Musical Notes"
FEEL(Experiential)
Music is a collection of notes, which are frequencies, played in sequence to each other.

When we say sequence, we say imagine a row of dominos tipping over on each other in sequence except the dominos are notes.

The feeling of the music is directly a consequence of 
'which notes' 
are played in 
'which sequence'
(in this example we are excluding lyrics, strictly instrumental musical 'notes')

In listening or playing music,
How is it that depending on which note is played next, the entire song changes feeling?
..and what determines 'which' kind of feeling is felt by the next note?

You guessed it.  Ratio.
Ratio in music is but another word to say 'relationship between notes/frequencies'.

Whenever we see the word ratio here, please substitute that if you like with the words "Energetic-Relationship"

These relationships have their roots in geometry, however for now let's illustrate this simply with a guitar string example.

When we play a note on the guitar, the sound (frequency) of the note is determined by 
the ratio between:
The length of the string
to
The length of the string where it stops at the finger pressing down on the note on the guitar neck


**Important to note (pun not intended), 'Ratio' is directly determined by frequency, 
not length of string or thickness per-say (string thickness also affects frequency produced);
The string can be thought of as a frequency conductor instead however.   
The length and thickness of the string are the initial conditions which lead to the corresponding frequency being produced through the conductor.*
*If the guitar was a frequency-generator, 
the finger picking the strings would be the induction current**


The crux of all we are saying here is:
Listening to any song 
when the next note that is played makes us feel a certain way or mood,
WHATEVER THAT FEELING MAY BE
anything from
nostalgia, suspense, romanticism, praise, mischief, sorrow, joy, sweetness
ALL
is determined solely by
the ratio between:
the frequency of the last note (or chord) played
to
the frequency of the current note (or chord) played

Thats why 
if it was a joyous song in a major key and then we suddenly played a minor-chord or note such as a 'minor-diminished' chord/note-progression,
it will immediately evoke 
a darker/reflective/sad/introspective kind of emotion in the listener no matter what language or culture they come from.

*IMPORTANT* (To get the most out of this section)
Keep close at hand the insight about how 
-Emotions- 
felt in music are a direct result of 
-ratio/relationships between notes/chords-  
..

To make this more personal,
Lets take a pause for a moment to fully absorb what this means Spiritually and Philosophically
We are going to break it down into bits and put it all into one single picture of oneness.

Imagine that the following is a fable, and go ahead seek to extract the moral lesson

1.
- Everything in the universe Oscillates/Vibrates, therefore Everything in the universe has a frequency
- The universe is comprised of soley *frequency (that which is vibrating/oscillating is plasma or 'ether' aka 'space').
- Humans can feel emotion naturally
=
- Music is comprised of notes 
- Notes are soley *frequency
- Musical notes/chords are inherently emotional


To recap here, what we are saying is the fundamental essence of that which is creating relationships between anything is:
-frequency-
Also, we are mentioning humans feel emotion naturally, as this is pertinent to what's next.
*I say 'naturally' here^ for some humans have felt such painful emotions that they conditioned themselves and learned to 'block-out' or
'dampen' feeling emotions,
and although sad, that is an example of an unnatural artificial impediment to nature,
for emotions are not an accident of nature but rather a direct channel of communication between nature/our-body/our-environment/and ourselves* 

Spiritually, we are saying all of our inter-personal relationships as well, are fundamentally relationships of frequency..


2.
- The Universe is an Open-System, not a Closed-System (there is no such thing as a 'closed-system' in Nature)
- In an Open-System, everything is connected and continuously communicating / interacting / exchanging-information with each other
- Connections / communications / interactions / information-exchange make up and define the basis of Relationships
=
- In music all notes have an ongoing open-relationship to the song, more specifically with the musical-key-signature of the song
- The frequency ratio between notes defines their relationship
- All ratio's in music are directly and repeatably correlated with the corresponding emotional feeling they elicit

To recap here, what we are saying is that, everything in the universe has a relationship with everything else, 
these relationships can be expressed in ratios as in music,
AND
these ratios each have their own corresponding -Emotion- 
-and so each unique ratio respectively represents and evokes that unique emotion-

Spiritually, we are saying not only is everything 'connected' in a completely literal and technical sense,
but that also that every one of these 'connections' are innerstood as real 'relationships' between beings, planets, cells, fields, creatures, stars,
AND
as we have seen relationship is our common-civilian-word for ratio,
the fact that all unique ratios possess a uniquely representative emotional feeling,
that means,
ALL RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE DEFINED BY THE EMOTION THEY EVOKE
...
Let me say that again for anyone who was dozing off from too much physics:

ALL RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE DEFINED BY THE EMOTION THEY EVOKE

Lets start this time with this last sentence as our first point 
3. 
- In the universe, all relationships can be defined by the emotional feeling they evoke
- In the universe, we have relationships not only to the beings around us, but to the universe itself
- The universe organizes itself into fractal divisions of space, all divisions nested embedded within each other as One Universe, One Field, One Energy
=
- In music, all musical parts of the song can be defined by the emotional feeling they evoke
- In music, every single note has a relationship not only to the notes that play in sequence right before & after,
	but to the musical-key-signature of the song itself
- All songs can be organized and divided into what we call segments, meters, and notes, all nested embedded within each other as One Song
 

To recap here what we are saying is that the wave-mechanics for music are the same for the natural world:
Fractal
&
Inter-dependant on Relationships
&
Ratio-Centric
&
Emotional (This one feels especially freeing to write)
&
Frequency-Based


What gets very interesting about this as well is that no matter if we change scales to different root notes, 
(for example from the key of G#major to Eminor)
the ratios, 
which are expressed in numeric values that look like 2/3, 4/3, 4/5 etc,
(for example, Major-Third chord relationship/ratio is 5/4, Perfect Fifth chord relationship/ratio is 3/2)
between 
the notes that sound 'harmonious' 
or between the notes that 'resonate' together 
stays the same,
as does also 
the ratio for the relationships between the notes that sound 'unharmonious' and between those that sound 'dissonant' 
stays the same

Said another way, no matter what key-frequency the song your note is in, you can still create beautiful relationships with the other notes,
it's not dependant on the song, it's dependant on the frequency of the notes themselves and when* and where* in what context they choose to play.

Philosphically and Spiritually,
Ratios speak to us at the most personal level 

What is it they say?

They say:
In life and in music we can create harmonious, even sublime sweet sentimental uplifting profound relationships with others
and with our environment no matter what 'circumstance' or 'song' we may find ourselves currently in...
It's not about the song...

"Fine Structure Constant"
THINK(Experiential)IMAGINE
Remember we are talking here about how the universe is relationship-centric, which has profound implications for all humans.

Physics is full of ratios which unintentionally re-appear and creep back up over and over again in our mathematical equations and calculations
of the natural world, everywhere from the quantum scale to the astronomical scale.

These ratios that show up and re-appear continuously when describing the universe in mathematics are called
'Mathematical Constants'.

One such mathematical constant is called the Fine Structure Constant, 
It's value is simplified to 
1/137 
and we write it using the greek letter Alpha.

It has no associated units of measurement  (like 'km/hr' or 'grams / cm^2'),
just the numeric ratio 1/137

Lets take a look at one such application of the Fine Structure Constant ratio 1/137, to show how ratios are just another word for relationship
between any two forces, frequencies, or systems.

The atom is continuously spinning.
The nucleus is spinning.
The electron cloud is spinning.

Remember how when a smoothie is spinning in the blender, how the very middle center of the smoothie spins faster than the outer edge?
Well the atom is exactly like this.
We can say the very center of the atom is spinning very very fast aproximately near the speed of light (at the planck threshold in the center)
Next then we ask ourselves,
"as we move outwards away from the center of the atom, 
how much slower are we spinning when we reach the electron cloud?"

1/137 the speed of light

That is,
the lowest electron orbital shell hugging closest to the atom is spinning at a speed 137 times slower than the speed of light.

This same ratio has also casually popped up uninvited and pulled up a chair in over again and again in equations over the past 100 years.
The equations from which 1/137 has greeted us most often involve 
fundamental interactions between charged particles (such as electron) and the electromagnetic force itself!

As just about everything we see with our 'physical' eyes is electromagnetism and not gravity,
one would accurately say the relationship 1/137 is actively involved in -everything we see-...

~137 happens to be the 33rd Prime, and there are 33 vertabrae in our spine~ 

To conclude with the Fine Structure Constant, we are meditating here together that interactions between all that we know as 'light', 
the 'reality' which reaches our eyes,
is defined and described by relationships of frequency.
These relationships between any set of frequencies we call -ratios-.




So what does this have to do with our day to day lives?
We are constantly in ratio with all of the different fields, forces, systems and frequencies of which make up all our universe.
We are constantly in ratio with
the Schumann Resonance field of the Earth, aka Gaia's bio-field,
We are constantly in ratio with





When we speak of relationships, most people think of their interpersonal relationships that they have in their life
here on Earth with their beloveds, friends, family, colleagues, employers.  
This is most appropriate to do so and a part of the picture, however this would leave out and exclude a majority of relationships.  
Why?

*Scale*
*Human-centric*

Our relationships with the other humans currently alive on earth only covers a small sliver of interactions and relationships and this is due to
the fact that the two main considerations have been completely left out: Scope and Human-centricism.

When we speak of scope, again we refer to the mental image of a microscope adjusting it's level of magnification so as to zoom out and see
everything that is there, not just "humans", 
but also "our bodies and our cells", "local communities", "earth", "our global and galactic communities", "the universe as Source".
These different scales or scopes of magnification can be called different levels of "pixel-resolutions".

Fully realizing that we have an ongoing relationship with all scopes of magnification opens up our being to the possibilities of much, much 
meaningfully deeper and richer roles to play and interactions to be had with all of life.

On human-centricism, we speak of the tendency of some (or many) humans of earth to be considering strictly only humans when carrying out their
day to day lives, as if the entire universe and reality consisted of only humans.
Ironically this has had a detrimental effect on humans;  
For when humans only focus on other humans, they miss learning from the rest of the natural world; 
Therefore then they are not able to harmonize as efficiently with the natural world, 
and thus may suffer illnesses mentally, emotionally, or in their body as a result.






---
Ratios can be modeled visually in a fluid medium as in the case of Cymatics.
A general idea looks like having two different inputs for frequency generation, both of which have a specific frequency ratio relationship
to each other like 5/4 and then generating those frequencies at different angles through a fluid-like medium such as water or silica.

********| LOVE | LOVE & PHI | *******

The subject of Love is going to take us to the heart of physics as,
the energetic qualities of what we call the emotion of Love has a royal center role to play in what we call 'negentropy' 
and therefore, as we shall see in 'creating life, sustaining life, and evolving life' 
.
I do not say this arbitrarily,
neither here do I say in romantic reverie; 
although that too is true, 
but rather after this chapter you too will fully innerstand this fact as a technical reality as well as conceptually know
the infinitely beautiful and yet astoundingly practical and engineerable energetic properties of Love in being able to
create in systems new higher forms of order; greater evolution / self-organization.


What we call Love and what we call Gravity are synonymous.

Let me give that kind of statement the explanation it deserves:

Gravity



Remember when we described how ratios are another way of talking about and describing relationships?
Great, because that means we are prepared for some astounding research and discoveries made available to us thanks to the work of Mr. Winter.

All waves have a point of max pressure.
The point of max pressure in a wave can be thought of as, "What point of the wave has the greatest energy density??"

All waves have a length of duration.
The length of duration of a wave can be visualized as the movement from the tip of the wave to the end of the wave.

The relationship between 
the point of max pressure in a wave
to
the length of duration of a wave
creates a Ratio!

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
********((( Universal Oneness vs. Compartmentalized Science | Why the Unified Approach? *******

Q&A
1.What is the compartmentalization of sciences

	Here now we reveal the severe limiting implications that arise from the way mainstream science today has been compartmentalized
	into different fields of 'seperate' little corners of study of the natural world.

	We start by asking what exactly is "the compartmentalization of sciences" in terms of what affect does this have on the way we traditionally
	approach the different sciences.
	
	Sciences are empirical fields of study that inquire ""what is the nature of reality" 
	-at a given scale/dimension-;
	Extra emphasis is given when we say "at a given scale" and here's why:
	When we say "at a given scale", 
	imagine a super microscope that can both see anything all the way from the size of the universe and as well
	to all the way down zooming in to the tiniest scales of all: the cell, atom, planck scale...

	It turns out the key to seeing why science has been compartmentalized and divided is because we have given different
	names every time we 'zoom-in' from a planet to a cell, or 'zoom-out' from an atom to a solar system,  
	to describe the study of -that specific 'resolution' or 'zoom-level' of scale/magnification-. 
	
	Said simply, 
	label-differences of standard scientific fields such as 'biology', 'chemistry', 'cosmology/astrophysics', 
	'quantum mechanics', 'general relativity', 'geobiology', are all the studies of 
	One Field, One Energy, One Dynamic
	just at different zooming in/out scopes of magnification.

	THIS LEADS TO 'SPECIALIZATION' which is when individuals tend to become specialized in a very Narrow scope of study in
	a single field... 

	Remember, the very definition of science is:
	"The non-bias methodical, observational, and experimental study of the Natural World in respect to evidence acquired by testable means"
	
	The intention of science is to learn about the Nature of Reality. 
	What's remarkable about the Nature of Reality / Natural World in general is that everything can be seen and innerstood simply as
	a system of inter-related parts where, the parts together are creating affects that are -not seperately possible- only together. 
	(We are not going to go into the holographic nature of these 'parts' containing the 'whole' within them just yet)

	That is, 
	just as our body is ONE system with MANY inter-related parts we call 'organs' and 
	just as EACH of our organs AFFECTS each OTHER organs
	it continues true that in the Universe, 
	all scales of magnification from the macro cosmic size to the micro quantum size continuously are exchanging information/energy/light
	with each other and all the scales affecting and reflecting all the other scales.
	
	You might recognize this principle as "As Above So Below" from Hermetic tradition and you would be correct to derive it's relevance here.

	Specialization in any field of study especially science overlooks the 'organ-like' structures of the universe.
	
	'Systems Theory' sums up and ties together this concept quite well.
	It says: 
	In any system, 
	there are effects that are created by the interactions of the 'different parts' of that system that are -not possible- ALONE 
	by any single one of the 'different parts'.

	Like only walking up and down one single hallway of knowledge in a mansion full of hallways where all hallways contain 
	references to each of the other hallways through inter-related 'decoration' and 'architecture' 
	and one only sees these references and repeating patterns if they have walked all around through the 
	different halls of the mansion to notice the 'uniform decoration/style' and 'repeating architecture' found throughout the whole mansion. 

	To illustrate how detrimental global scientific specialization is to humanity's collective worldviews, 
	consider this silly but illuminating example that is probably not as rare as I type it up to be.


	"The Specialized Auto Mechanic"
	THINK(Metaphor)IMAGINE
		Cars are one system comprised of many individual parts or 'organs'.  The motor(heart), the battery(lungs), wheels(body), 
		the electronic system(nervous system), the coolant(perspiration), the lights(eyes)... 
		etc I am missing many parts as cars are not my muse. 
		Imagine an auto mechanic who is specialized only in fixing, replacing, and building just One of these auto-parts. 
		Imagine this auto mechanic does not know how all the other parts work or how they connect to the One part they know about.
		Good... now imagine every time that One piece malfunctions, you take it to the same auto mechanic to fix it or replace it.
		Imagine that every time the One piece is replaced/fixed by this auto mechanic, it malfunctions again shortly after...
		Why?
		Just as our cardiovascular system is affected by our digestive system and vice versa, 
		ALL CAR PARTS ARE INTIMATELY INTER-RELATED INTO ONE SYSTEM.
		The condition of one part ultimately affects all other parts to some degree by the exchange of energy between these parts in association.
		Therefore,
		the ideal auto mechanic is one who sees a car and sees One System and specializes Not in any 'single part' of the system,
		but rather specializes in -Relationships- between 'parts'.


	This gets into a quite hot subject about how many errors and misunderstandings in science historically are due to 
	the different compartments of science not talking to each other!
	
	When different-but-interrelated fields/scales of science do not talk to each other and do not share their findings / research
	with each other due to the narrowness specialization that comes with compartmentalizing sciences,
	these fields remain incomplete and often have added 'ad-hoc' (arbitrarily created) elements to their theories to explain
	the very phenomenas which, unbeknownst to them are being produced by other scales, 
	not locally as they would like to believe, 
	but thanks to the -relationship- created between them and all the other interrelated scales of OTHER FIELDS OF SCIENCE,
	and therefore they miss out on crucial pieces of the puzzle which they all each respectively hold and contribute to the complete
	picture of reality we call the Universe.
	
	In effect, with the compartmentalization of sciences we get something similar to how there are many distinct religions talking about 
	the very same concepts of Love and Oneness in different cultures, times, and geographical locations, 
	yet historically they have chosen to remain seperate and indifferent to each other,
	not seeing the messages that remain constantly similar throughout them all...
	
	As one of my great teachers would say, 
	Jesus Christ and Einstein were talking about the same thing... One Field... all is one.
	As another one of my great teachers would say,
	the Universe does not do math... it does 'relationships' also known as 'ratios'.  
	I would add math simply aims at describing and equating these relationships which already exist in the Universe.

2. How does unified physics resolve the disparity and seperateness found in Current Science?
	- Scale invariant
	- Pure Principles | Fundamental Principles
		Frequency, Energy Levels, Entropy/Negentropy, Positive/Negative-Charge, Geometric Relationships 
Examples in Science:

"Medicine"
 FEEL(Experiential) - All organs have a unique resonant frequency, like a key or musical note that belongs only to that specific organ.
The resonant frequency can be thought of as the 'home-base' or frequency at which the system -or in our case 'organ', 
prefers to stay 'at' vibrating and generating waves at that frequency.  
The unique resonant frequency for which a system finds 'preferance' to stay at is determined by whichever frequency
generates naturally the greatest amplitude of waves throughout the system.
Amplitude is directly related to 'intensity' in physics.  Therefore the system seeks to resonate at the frequency which
allows the system (or organ) to generate waves at it's fullest greatest capacity.
For example, the resonant frequencies of human lungs has been found to be 25 hz for men and 33 hz for women. 
The eyeball has a resonant frequency of 19hz.  
Today we have available to us the online documentation through research publications
containing the dominant resonant frequencies for the human body and it's organs.
You can clearly measure the difference between an organ in 'Optimal Health' versus an organ in 'Poor Health' 
through -fundamental principles of resonant frequency-  by SIMPLY measuring the dominant frequencies at which
that organ is resonating at electromagnetically and comparing that to it's -natural resonant frequency-.  
In just this one example of countless medical applications we are seeing how: 
by approaching medicine with pure principles of unified physics, 
we may now then bio-medically use this information to engineer technology with the purpose of Re-Tuning Organs to their 'Optimal health' 
by producing a flow of electric voltage/energy/prana tuned to the unique resonant frequency belonging to 
that resonant state at which the organ is in 'Optimal Health'.  The flow of electric voltage at that unique resonant frequency will
create a -new- electromagnetic field around the organ, imagine it as a bubble, which Re-Tunes the organ to "Optimal Health"

we are really only looking at One thing,

As the string gets played more and more over time gradually it loses some of it's original harmonics.
We are saying this equals losing 'fullness of expression' of a note.

This may not seem obvious to some.
The guitar string is not the note being played,
it is -The Carrier-;
It may be poetically likened to a messenger,
or 'one who invokes a message'
The messenger is NOT the message.
The message in this case is the note.
Where does the message originally come from?

You see how this is leading us to now walking into 'field' theory 
or what Pythagoras called the "Ringing of the Spheres"
for there can be no messenger without message,
That is to say,
When we play a guitar 


The string is analogous to 'our body' resonating at its 'current' state.
We say 'current' because the string can decay a bit over time to environmental conditions including playing,
