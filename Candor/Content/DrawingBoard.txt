********( ENTANGLEMENT : PHASELOCKING ACROSS SCALES VIA PHI / GOLDEN-RATIO)*******

	Phi/golden-ratio is the ratio phase discipline among waves which phase-locks always with each other across all scales. 
As phased race as phi golden ratio is the ratio in which small waves embed into large waves fractally infinitely. 
Model three dimensionally a dodecahedron and icosahedron embedded within each other repeating to infinity the dodecahedron

represents the Phi golden ratio with phase discipline geometry 
and the icosahedron represents the Isotropic vector matrix which is the hexagonal

Double tetrahedron
which is the exact merkaba tetrahedrons 
and they embed within each other now fate the five golden ratio is also the ratio which face locks the brain with the breathing with the heart and now, 
this leads to with developing ether technology we build the technology in such a way that it obeys Phi / Golden-Ratio way harmonic wave geometry 
in its architectural and material and geometric properties and we can also think of the zero points or either technology generating device 
as a body as a body has a heart brain and nervous system

different systems as well as systems to output,
and where systems output is where the symmetry is broken with the whole like the mouth or the ears

we can output and extract energy or information from inside this from within. 

Symmetry is where we can extract energy so, how do we look receiver for that energy questions we can proceed now with evolution and evolution of a system 

oh we are thinking about neural networks and a machine learning AI program that is learning and we use that example. 
Then we mentioned that humans is not limited to anything at all is not limited and so, okay. 

So our code data information that we're being fed with build our neural networks and evolve what

data receive this attention and attention is intimately linked with meditation and the practice of directing one's focus to whatever point or scope one

and. What what happens is between associated information we begin to build connections and those connections are highways for information transfer. 
Those are new rivers highway paths for information transfer, new lines, vector lines, for chart for charge geometry new lines and the geometry and the geometry of the snowflake.


The beauty of learning a subject or learning in general, from many different angles one once fractal geometry

once geometry begins to connect, and be fractal and it all connects and becomes one.

For example,
For years the different angles of experience in my consciousness remained fractionated, isolated, from each other

Imagine a hexagon

And so each fractionation took on
was an oil painter, a musician, a linguist, a software developer,

becomes a fractal thought form it can become a black hole in itself.




Tetra octacube dodeca icosa is the inverse implosion order for the nest of platonic solids,
The tetra octa cube cannot make it in the dodeca icosa without abiding by golden ratio (stellation? )
A profound yet ever present philosophical point regarding abiding In Love,
And In Love we connect with and 'exchange inertia' and talk to and work and play with the larger and smaller scales...
We are the tetra octa cube (h2o) and Gaia and galaxy and atom is dodeca icosa


The geometry of the nucleus is dodeca. 21st century mag

Kepler noticed that the ratio between the orbitals of the 6 known planets of the time was the same ratio as the 6 nested platonic solids


An electron cloud is a cloud of charge which is a cloud of condensed plasma,
AND
Then mass is

IONS ARE FREE ELECTRONS
ELECTRONS ARE CHARGE,
MASSLESS CHARGE (NEAR MASSLESS)
AND
MASS
IS
FURTHER MORE CONDENSED PLASMA THAN ELECTRONS
As the plasma condenses more and becomes mass it is becoming more centripetal and dense
Electrons or electric effects are found wherever there is mass,
And can be thought of as a kind of plasmic electromagnetic aura surrounding anything with mass,
Just like anything with mass also has accompanying it a gravitational scalar/longitudinal aspect/force
