	II.b. Why does Phase Embedding occur?
		Phase embedding occurs naturally when shorter wave life-cycles fit into longer wave life-cycles,
		and occurs as a natural phenomena in the universe just as it does in music for the same reason that
		we find the same kinds of organically created geometrically structured systems like the helix and torus 
		structures repeatedly throughout the universe everywhere we look:  
		To maintain equilibrium by conserving inertia inwards throughout the system in free flowing balanced proportions.
		Said another way, it is nature's solution to retaining it's thermodynamic potential.

In our inquiry into the nature of Waves we start with:
As everything in the universe is One plasma medium superfluid, this One Substance some call Akasha, Ether,
takes the form, shape, and behavior of what we call waves. 

These waves, like all energy, adhere to energetic principles of frequency, spin-rate, and energy levels.

These wave collectively all behave in toroidal dynamics; 
That is, 
the flow-path and shapes of these waves are primarily in phase-discipline with the geometry of a torus.

Why a torus?  A torus has all the vector possibilities for waves to flow inwards (gravitation),
flow outwards (electromagnetism), 
and as well to flow in spinning spirals of centripetal rotation (mass), 
thus conserving inertia (energy).

This study of the nature of waves is precisely what we call wave-mechanics.

We are going to meditate here now upon an aspect of wave-mechanics called the "phase"/"phasing" of a wave,
to acquire some insight 'inner sight' related to waves along with what it means for a wave to "phase-embed",
"phase-lock", "phase-shift", and as well what we refer to when we talk about the "phase-discipline" of a wave
or any arbitrary system.


I.) PHASES
I.a.) What are Phases?
We can summarize what a wave phase is by saying it is the current place and 'timing' of a wave along it's rhythmical 
life-cycle path. 
	To develop an intuitive feel for what a wave phase is, lets look at a few tangible examples.

'Playing Music'
FEEL(EXPERIENTIAL) - Imagine you are musician.  Surely some of you are, however all of you have heard music (hopefully?!).
Now imagine you are sitting down in a chair with your instrument in a hallway between three rooms.
In each of the three rooms, there is a different musical band playing.
In each of the three rooms, each seperate band is playing at their own different tempo, different tuning, different keys,
and different songs.  
All bands are playing at the same time, except they cannot hear each other, but you CAN while sitting in the hallway.
You hear all three bands at the same time.
	
Remember, all music is waves, compression waves.
Therefore a musical song is a wave life-cycle.

Phases are wave life-cycles; More specifically, the phase of a wave refers to where the waves currently are at in 
their respective wave life-cycle, both literally in time/space coordinates and as well energetically in terms of
qualitative wave properties.  
Wave life-cycles have all of the normal properties of waves such as frequency,
intensity/amplification, and rate of speed/spin.  
	
So in this example above, 
each of the three respective whole bands that are playing are each, three unique phases. 

Yes each musician in each band is a phase too, and so we say each musician is 'phase-locked' with each other,
and as a collective they are phase-locked into the grand overall unifying 'phase' of the band as a whole.

However if all the musicians in one of the bands in one room all are playing at different points of the song,
beginning, middle, end  -At the same time-, then we say they are "out of phase".
(simultaneously if someone is at the beginning, someone is playing at the middle, someone is playing the ending,
all in same band this would be clearly out of phase)

In our example,
as we are in the hallways listening to these three bands/phases play at once, what if we start to play our
instrument in the hallway along to, and in the same key, tempo, and tuning as one specific band out of the three?
You would be correct in saying that you have 'phase-locked' into their band's 'phase'.

For musicians, from experience I can say this moment of phase-locking with other musicians in a song is a very real 
distinct feeling that literally feels like you are locking into a very specific set of tempo, rythmic, and tuning 
conditions that all form a 'wave' that you as the musician are trying to, like a surfer, first 
'catch' (phase-shift into) the wave and then, 'surf' 
(now once phase-locked in, playing music in that song
aka channeling-consciousness-in-accordance-to-the-phase-discipline-one-is-in)


What if now,
as a musician in the hallway playing along to one of the bands, we change and switch from that band to 
instead now start playing along with another one of the other two distinct bands?

If we switch our playing from playing along with one band to playing with another, this is what 








IMAGINE(VISUALIZE) - Imagine two seperate flocks of distinct species of birds we will call Species.A.and 
Species.B.
Imagine Species.A. flies in a flock across the continent and back each year. 
Now imagine Species.B. doesnt flock across the continent, they only mostly stay in one area.
Now imagine that once every year, Species.A. crosses paths with Species.B. 

Now lets say each and every bird in both Species.A. and Species.B. flocks represents a 'wave'.
Okay good, the stage is set.
To innerstand "phase", "phase-lock", and "phase-shift" lets see in our example where are the phases, where do
they lock, and where do they shift?

Species.A.'s flight travel path is a phase.  So is Species.B's.

When either Species.A. or Species.B flies in a tight synchronized formation, 
like the kind you see performed by military jet-planes or by a beehive swarming around the Queen Bee, 
we say those birds/waves have 'phase-locked' together.

When these two flocks cross each other's path, if a bird from Species.A. seperates and flies off with the
Species.B. flock, we say it has 'phase-shifted'.  

Also when a bird in Species.A. or B. breaks away from the 'tight formation' flight path of the birds and begins to
do it's own flight path, albeit still part of the same flock if it breaks away from or breaks into the 
leading tight formation (like we see in military jet planes as mentioned above), 
then we also say it has 'phase-shifted'.


III.) Phase-Locking
III.a.) What is Phase-locking

Three conceptually helpful real examples to intuit phaselocking are that of lightning bugs, metronomes, 
and the female menstrual cycles. 

'Fireflies / Lightning Bugs'
THINK(Experiential) - "Fireflies" or "Lightning bugs" (their real name escapes me and lightning bugs is more fun) 
are a specific kind of insect

'Metronomes'
THINK(Experiential) - Metronomes as we know are a device with a pendulum that swings back and forth, back and forth
with a 'click' sound every time it swings 'back' and 'forth' and it sounds like this:  'tick' 'tick' 'tick' tick' 'tick'.
The metronome marks time with it's clicking and this is what it is used for.
What happens if we put a bunch of metronomes in


*Menstrual Cycles*
THINK(Experiential) -  It is reportedly common for women who live together and/or spend much time together near daily to 
'phaselock' menstrual cycles with each other so that, although they may initially had their menstrual cycles at
seperate different times of the month, after so long of sharing space and intertwining their plasmic-aura bio-fields
with each other they eventually phase-lock menstrual cycles and start to have their period at the same times as each other.


Now that we innerstand some common everyday examples of phases and phaselocking,
lets dig into the fundamental principles of the wave-mechanics at play
---How and why does phases and phaselocking occur in the flow dynamics of universal Torus-structure plasma systems? 



III.b.) Why, when and how does phase-locking occur?


(The why illuminates the when and how)
"Why?" - Phaselocking waves together into a single phase is one of the most natural functions of the universe because
phaselocking is how the universe and all systems in it conserve inertia / energy / charge.
That is, 
Phase-locking together with Phase-embedding is one of the main ways in which the Universe or any systems or
sub-systems in general conserve inertia.  By conserving inertia we mean conserving plasma, energy, or by 
definition conserving the ability to do work.
	
"When" - A wave phase-locks in together with another wave's phase or with the phase of a collective group of waves when
it's phase inhabits the same magnetic and/or plasma field throughout-which another wave phase or phases group is flowing
through in constant uniformity.  
Constant uniformity is another word for fractal, or self-symmetry.
All waves of energy/magnetism/ether flow towards fractal systems.
Therefore, waves tend to phase-lock to the most self-symmetrical fractal system nearby in terms of geometry,
as this is what will allow the wave to retain it's greatest amount of inertia,
Whether it's a metronome phase-locking to a collective group of metronomes, a woman phase-locking with another
woman, a firefly phase-locking to a collective group of fireflies, 
BECAUSE
It is easier energetically for a wave to follow the phase of a larger field within which it is embedded than to 
pursue it's own independant phase (wave life-cycle).

(It's also easier to follow what others are doing instead of making our own decisions for our own life path)


"How?" - Phase-lock occurs when the energetic qualities of a wave suddenly 'locks in' and tunes energetically in phase 
	to match the energetic qualities and phase of another wave or a larger collection of waves nearby.
	
	This is equivalent to a street parade or military march how they all march in phase.



III.b.a.) - Phase-locking to natural systems vs artificial systems and institutions



---Now what does phases and phaselocking have to do with fractality and geometry?
(hint: constructive vs destructive wave interference)

---What does phases and phaselocking have to do with reported 'synchronicity' 
(Synchronicity as in the experience of external events coinciding with mirroring our internal world in a 
personally meaningful way:  
For example just when you are beginning to write a book about physics, you go to see one of your favorite musicians
in concert, and right beside you you 'synchronistically' spontaneously meet an older fellow who, come to find out is a
physicist and mathematician (out of all possibiilities) with whom you have an intensely meaningful conversation with
and is interested in looking over your writings via email)

********( PHASES:  ENTANGLEMENT : PHASELOCKING ACROSS SCALES VIA PHI / GOLDEN-RATIO)*******







	Phi/golden-ratio is the ratio phase discipline among waves which phase-locks always with each other across all scales. 
As phased race as phi golden ratio is the ratio in which small waves embed into large waves fractally infinitely. 
Model three dimensionally a dodecahedron and icosahedron embedded within each other repeating to infinity the dodecahedron

represents the Phi golden ratio with phase discipline geometry 
and the icosahedron represents the Isotropic vector matrix which is the hexagonal

Double tetrahedron
which is the exact merkaba tetrahedrons 
and they embed within each other now fate the five golden ratio is also the ratio which face locks the brain with the breathing with the heart and now, 
this leads to with developing ether technology we build the technology in such a way that it obeys Phi / Golden-Ratio way harmonic wave geometry 
in its architectural and material and geometric properties and we can also think of the zero points or either technology generating device 
as a body as a body has a heart brain and nervous system

different systems as well as systems to output,
and where systems output is where the symmetry is broken with the whole like the mouth or the ears

we can output and extract energy or information from inside this from within. 

Symmetry is where we can extract energy so, how do we look receiver for that energy questions we can proceed now with evolution and evolution of a system 

oh we are thinking about neural networks and a machine learning AI program that is learning and we use that example. 
Then we mentioned that humans is not limited to anything at all is not limited and so, okay. 

So our code data information that we're being fed with build our neural networks and evolve what

data receive this attention and attention is intimately linked with meditation and the practice of directing one's focus to whatever point or scope one

and. What what happens is between associated information we begin to build connections and those connections are highways for information transfer. 
Those are new rivers highway paths for information transfer, new lines, vector lines, for chart for charge geometry new lines and the geometry and the geometry of the snowflake.


The beauty of learning a subject or learning in general, from many different angles one once fractal geometry

once geometry begins to connect, and be fractal and it all connects and becomes one.

For example,
For years the different angles of experience in my consciousness remained fractionated, isolated, from each other

Imagine a hexagon

And so each fractionation took on
was an oil painter, a musician, a linguist, a software developer,

becomes a fractal thought form it can become a black hole in itself.




Tetra octacube dodeca icosa is the inverse implosion order for the nest of platonic solids,
The tetra octa cube cannot make it in the dodeca icosa without abiding by golden ratio (stellation? )
A profound yet ever present philosophical point regarding abiding In Love,
And In Love we connect with and 'exchange inertia' and talk to and work and play with the larger and smaller scales...
We are the tetra octa cube (h2o) and Gaia and galaxy and atom is dodeca icosa


The geometry of the nucleus is dodeca. 21st century mag

Kepler noticed that the ratio between the orbitals of the 6 known planets of the time was the same ratio as the 6 nested platonic solids


An electron cloud is a cloud of charge which is a cloud of condensed plasma,
AND
Then mass is

IONS ARE FREE ELECTRONS
ELECTRONS ARE CHARGE,
MASSLESS CHARGE (NEAR MASSLESS)
AND
MASS
IS
FURTHER MORE CONDENSED PLASMA THAN ELECTRONS
As the plasma condenses more and becomes mass it is becoming more centripetal and dense
Electrons or electric effects are found wherever there is mass,
And can be thought of as a kind of plasmic electromagnetic aura surrounding anything with mass,
Just like anything with mass also has accompanying it a gravitational scalar/longitudinal aspect/force
