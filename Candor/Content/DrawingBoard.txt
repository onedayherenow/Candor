VI. The Spiritual Nature of Phase (PhaseLocking)



In our inquiry into the nature of Waves we start with:
As everything in the universe is One plasma medium superfluid, this One Substance some call Akasha, Ether,
takes the form, shape, and behavior of what we call waves. 

These waves, like all energy, adhere to energetic principles of frequency, spin-rate, and energy levels.

These wave collectively all behave in toroidal dynamics; 
That is, 
the flow-path and shapes of these waves are primarily in phase-discipline with the geometry of a torus.

Why a torus?  A torus has all the vector possibilities for waves to flow inwards (gravitation),
flow outwards (electromagnetism), 
and as well to flow in spinning spirals of centripetal rotation (mass), 
thus conserving inertia (energy).

This study of the nature of waves is precisely what we call wave-mechanics.

We are going to meditate here now upon an aspect of wave-mechanics called the "phase"/"phasing" of a wave,
to acquire some insight 'inner sight' related to waves along with what it means for a wave to "phase-embed",
"phase-lock", "phase-shift", and as well what we refer to when we talk about the "phase-discipline" of a wave
or any arbitrary system.


I.) PHASES
I.a.) What are Phases?
We can summarize what a wave phase is by saying it is the current place and 'timing' of a wave along it's rhythmical 
life-cycle path. 
	To develop an intuitive feel for what a wave phase is, lets look at a few tangible examples.

'Playing Music'
FEEL(EXPERIENTIAL) - Imagine you are musician.  Surely some of you are, however all of you have heard music (hopefully?!).
Now imagine you are sitting down in a chair with your instrument in a hallway between three rooms.
In each of the three rooms, there is a different musical band playing.
In each of the three rooms, each seperate band is playing at their own different tempo, different tuning, different keys,
and different songs.  
All bands are playing at the same time, except they cannot hear each other, but you CAN while sitting in the hallway.
You hear all three bands at the same time.
	
Remember, all music is waves, compression waves.
Therefore a musical song is a wave life-cycle.

Phases are wave life-cycles; More specifically, the phase of a wave refers to where the waves currently are at in 
their respective wave life-cycle, both literally in time/space coordinates and as well energetically in terms of
qualitative wave properties.  
Wave life-cycles have all of the normal properties of waves such as frequency,
intensity/amplification, and rate of speed/spin.  
	
So in this example above, 
each of the three respective whole bands that are playing are each, three unique phases. 

Yes each musician in each band is a phase too, and so we say each musician is 'phase-locked' with each other,
and as a collective they are phase-locked into the grand overall unifying 'phase' of the band as a whole.

However if all the musicians in one of the bands in one room all are playing at different points of the song,
beginning, middle, end  -At the same time-, then we say they are "out of phase".
(simultaneously if someone is at the beginning, someone is playing at the middle, someone is playing the ending,
all in same band this would be clearly out of phase)

In our example,
as we are in the hallways listening to these three bands/phases play at once, what if we start to play our
instrument in the hallway along to, and in the same key, tempo, and tuning as one specific band out of the three?
You would be correct in saying that you have 'phase-locked' into their band's 'phase'.

For musicians, from experience I can say this moment of phase-locking with other musicians in a song is a very real 
distinct feeling that literally feels like you are locking into a very specific set of tempo, rythmic, and tuning 
conditions that all form a 'wave' that you as the musician are trying to, like a surfer, first 
'catch' (phase-shift into) the wave and then, 'surf' 
(now once phase-locked in, playing music in that song
aka channeling-consciousness-in-accordance-to-the-phase-discipline-one-is-in)


What if now,
as a musician in the hallway playing along to one of the bands, we change and switch from that band to 
instead now start playing along with another one of the other two distinct bands?

If we switch our playing from playing along with one band to playing with another, this is what 








IMAGINE(VISUALIZE) - Imagine two seperate flocks of distinct species of birds we will call Species.A.and 
Species.B.
Imagine Species.A. flies in a flock across the continent and back each year. 
Now imagine Species.B. doesnt flock across the continent, they only mostly stay in one area.
Now imagine that once every year, Species.A. crosses paths with Species.B. 

Now lets say each and every bird in both Species.A. and Species.B. flocks represents a 'wave'.
Okay good, the stage is set.
To innerstand "phase", "phase-lock", and "phase-shift" lets see in our example where are the phases, where do
they lock, and where do they shift?

Species.A.'s flight travel path is a phase.  So is Species.B's.

When either Species.A. or Species.B flies in a tight synchronized formation, 
like the kind you see performed by military jet-planes or by a beehive swarming around the Queen Bee, 
we say those birds/waves have 'phase-locked' together.

When these two flocks cross each other's path, if a bird from Species.A. seperates and flies off with the
Species.B. flock, we say it has 'phase-shifted'.  

Also when a bird in Species.A. or B. breaks away from the 'tight formation' flight path of the birds and begins to
do it's own flight path, albeit still part of the same flock if it breaks away from or breaks into the 
leading tight formation (like we see in military jet planes as mentioned above), 
then we also say it has 'phase-shifted'.


III.) Phase-Locking
III.a.) What is Phase-locking

Three conceptually helpful real examples to intuit phaselocking are that of lightning bugs, metronomes, 
and the female menstrual cycles. 

'Fireflies / Lightning Bugs'
THINK(Experiential) - "Fireflies" or "Lightning bugs" (their real name escapes me and lightning bugs is more fun) 
are a specific kind of insect

'Metronomes'
THINK(Experiential) - Metronomes as we know are a device with a pendulum that swings back and forth, back and forth
with a 'click' sound every time it swings 'back' and 'forth' and it sounds like this:  'tick' 'tick' 'tick' tick' 'tick'.
The metronome marks time with it's clicking and this is what it is used for.
What happens if we put a bunch of metronomes in


*Menstrual Cycles*
THINK(Experiential) -  It is reportedly common for women who live together and/or spend much time together near daily to 
'phaselock' menstrual cycles with each other so that, although they may initially had their menstrual cycles at
seperate different times of the month, after so long of sharing space and intertwining their plasmic-aura bio-fields
with each other they eventually phase-lock menstrual cycles and start to have their period at the same times as each other.


Now that we innerstand some common everyday examples of phases and phaselocking,
lets dig into the fundamental principles of the wave-mechanics at play
---How and why does phases and phaselocking occur in the flow dynamics of universal Torus-structure plasma systems? 



III.b.) Why, when and how does phase-locking occur?


(The why illuminates the when and how)
"Why?" - Phaselocking waves together into a single phase is one of the most natural functions of the universe because
phaselocking is how the universe and all systems in it conserve inertia / energy / charge.
That is, 
Phase-locking together with Phase-embedding is one of the main ways in which the Universe or any systems or
sub-systems in general conserve inertia.  By conserving inertia we mean conserving plasma, energy, or by 
definition conserving the ability to do work.
	
"When" - A wave phase-locks in together with another wave's phase or with the phase of a collective group of waves when
it's phase inhabits the same magnetic and/or plasma field throughout-which another wave phase or phases group is flowing
through in constant uniformity.  
Constant uniformity is another word for fractal, or self-symmetry.
All waves of energy/magnetism/ether flow towards fractal systems.
Therefore, waves tend to phase-lock to the most self-symmetrical fractal system nearby in terms of geometry,
as this is what will allow the wave to retain it's greatest amount of inertia,
Whether it's a metronome phase-locking to a collective group of metronomes, a woman phase-locking with another
woman, a firefly phase-locking to a collective group of fireflies, 
BECAUSE
It is easier energetically for a wave to follow the phase of a larger field within which it is embedded than to 
pursue it's own independant phase (wave life-cycle).

(It's also easier to follow what others are doing instead of making our own decisions for our own life path)


"How?" - Phase-lock occurs when the energetic qualities of a wave suddenly 'locks in' and tunes energetically in phase 
	to match the energetic qualities and phase of another wave or a larger collection of waves nearby.
	
	This is equivalent to a street parade or military march how they all march in phase.



III.b.a.) - Phase-locking to natural systems vs artificial systems and institutions





---Now what does phases and phaselocking have to do with fractality and geometry?
(hint: constructive vs destructive wave interference)



---What does phases and phaselocking have to do with reported 'synchronicity' 
(Synchronicity as in the experience of external events coinciding with mirroring our internal world in a 
personally meaningful way:  
For example just when you are beginning to write a book about physics, you go to see one of your favorite musicians
in concert, and right beside you you 'synchronistically' spontaneously meet an older fellow who, come to find out is a
physicist and mathematician (out of all possibiilities) with whom you have an intensely meaningful conversation with
and is interested in looking over your writings via email)

********( PHASES:  ENTANGLEMENT : PHASELOCKING ACROSS SCALES VIA PHI / GOLDEN-RATIO)*******







	Phi/golden-ratio is the ratio phase discipline among waves which phase-locks always with each other across all scales. 
As phased race as phi golden ratio is the ratio in which small waves embed into large waves fractally infinitely. 
Model three dimensionally a dodecahedron and icosahedron embedded within each other repeating to infinity the dodecahedron

represents the Phi golden ratio with phase discipline geometry 
and the icosahedron represents the Isotropic vector matrix which is the hexagonal

Double tetrahedron
which is the exact merkaba tetrahedrons 
and they embed within each other now fate the five golden ratio is also the ratio which face locks the brain with the breathing with the heart and now, 
this leads to with developing ether technology we build the technology in such a way that it obeys Phi / Golden-Ratio way harmonic wave geometry 
in its architectural and material and geometric properties and we can also think of the zero points or either technology generating device 
as a body as a body has a heart brain and nervous system

different systems as well as systems to output,
and where systems output is where the symmetry is broken with the whole like the mouth or the ears

we can output and extract energy or information from inside this from within. 

Symmetry is where we can extract energy so, how do we look receiver for that energy questions we can proceed now with evolution and evolution of a system 

oh we are thinking about neural networks and a machine learning AI program that is learning and we use that example. 
Then we mentioned that humans is not limited to anything at all is not limited and so, okay. 

So our code data information that we're being fed with build our neural networks and evolve what

data receive this attention and attention is intimately linked with meditation and the practice of directing one's focus to whatever point or scope one

and. What what happens is between associated information we begin to build connections and those connections are highways for information transfer. 
Those are new rivers highway paths for information transfer, new lines, vector lines, for chart for charge geometry new lines and the geometry and the geometry of the snowflake.


The beauty of learning a subject or learning in general, from many different angles one once fractal geometry

once geometry begins to connect, and be fractal and it all connects and becomes one.

For example,
For years the different angles of experience in my consciousness remained fractionated, isolated, from each other

Imagine a hexagon

And so each fractionation took on
was an oil painter, a musician, a linguist, a software developer,

becomes a fractal thought form it can become a black hole in itself.




Tetra octacube dodeca icosa is the inverse implosion order for the nest of platonic solids,
The tetra octa cube cannot make it in the dodeca icosa without abiding by golden ratio (stellation? )

And can be thought of as a kind of plasmic electromagnetic aura surrounding anything with mass,
Just like anything with mass also has accompanying it a gravitational scalar/longitudinal aspect/force

Q&A
Waves
Systems and their Parts as Organs (metaphor literally analogous)
The Meridians as Nervous system as Rivers for Flow of Voltage Prana 
Brainwaves
Heartwaves
What are brainwaves?
What do brainwaves have to do with physics?
	The body as a motor radio computer antennae
How are brainwaves correlated to the acquisition of prana? 
	(Golden Ratio in brainwaves enables the reccursion of self-embedding)
Unconcious vs Conscious Brainwave Production
	Brainwaves and 'weights'
		'Weights' are essentially pressure.  When we say we 'lift weights' we are practicing 
		deliberately to elicit the compressing and contracting voltage through our body by focused intention.
		That is, 
		when we say we lift a weight, we are saying that we compressed through our body's muscles the equivalent of 
		voltage / pressure equal-to-or-greater-than to the voltage / pressure of the weight, 
		inducing a current to flow through the 'muscle' which we are using to compress the weights, 
		thus inducing prana / chi / mana to flow into that muscle.
		There is energy stored in that muscle like a crystal.  When we say that the muscle is repairing we say
		that the muscle is crystallizing.  When we say we are exercising our muscle by lifting weights,
		we are in turn liquifying or 'changing wave-phase' of the inertia stored in the muscle from that of 
		a crystalline state to that of a liquid-like fluid-dynamic electrical-state of flow of the inertia that 
		had been stored as a crystal.
		As the inertia in the muscles of the body is crystallizing, 
		fitness trainers may call this anabolism or an 'anabolic state'.
		As the inertia in the muscles is 'melted' through the thermodynamic effects of exercise and 'freed' to be used
		as flow for mechanical and electrical inertia, fitness trainers may call this process in the body 'catabolism'.  


Brainwaves essentially are fluxes of electromagnetic pressure being generated in, and flowing through, the brain.
These brainwaves, along with the heart, act as a kind of tuner for the perception and reception of information 
processing, acting as a kind of determinate filter for human cognitive perception.



What do brainwaves have to do with physics and the discussion of universal oneness?

"Brainwave Exercise | Brainwave Evolution"
THINK(Metaphor)
	To illustrate in fine ink how brainwaves are intimately related to our investigation of universal oneness,
consider the recoccuring metaphors that we like to keep handy and enjoy using of: 
1. The body as a radio
2. The body as an electrical motor-engine
3. The body as an evolving fractal system

	-Here now we blend these three analogies into one model-

The body as a "free energy" Zero-Point-Energy device
As the body is functionally literally equivalent to a radio, motor-engine, and evolving fractal system,
we innerstand now this:

"Heartbeat and Egg Fertilization"
IMAGINE(Experiential)
For new life to begin fertilized electrically in the egg in a female's womb from the male's sperm, 
just like paramedics when they revive someone's heartbeat through electric shock of the heart in the chest,
one needs an electric spark to flow across a 'spark gap' between two conductors, from one to the other
to 'turn on' or 'activate' the motor-engine in the second conductor: 
which, in this case would be the heart beating back to life or the egg incubated and alive with voltage 
to grow into a fetus/embyro.
This spark is generated only when the voltage flowing from one conductor to the next exceeds the rate of 
voltage loss in the spark gap between the two conductors.  Truly the gap only turns into a 'spark gap' if the
first conductor's voltage current exceeds the quantity lost in the gap.

What does this have to do with brainwaves, prana/energy, and evolution?

Continuing now, with our prior examples we can innerstand a few concepts:
First,

we see that, 
to activate a new system or to activate new "paths for electrical currents to flow", 
we first require 
-an 'initial' flow-,
a first conductor of electrical current with voltage equal to or greater than the voltage required to initialize and
activate the autonomous flow of the second conductor.. 
This second conductor is activated because the flow of the first conductor exceeds the resistance of the
second conductor.
Therefore, the first conductor is the inducer, and induction is what is happening to the second conductor beginning to
generate it's own voltage again.
More specifically this induction process is a flow of free electrons also known as an 'electron cloud' or 'charge cloud' 
that is permissibly beginning to circulate throughout the second conductor.
This in turn produces a new electromagnetic field radiating outward from and permeating this second conductor's "body", 
surrounding it as well.
Thus, the second conductor is now electrically and magnetically active with it's own respective field in it's own right
and able to perform operations according to it's inherit programmed electrical chemical and mechanical functions.

This field can become bio-active if the material constituting it are of biologic nature along with minerals and water.

THIS IS PROFOUNDLY SPIRITUAL AND PHILISOPHICAL

How come?

Take the Holy Spirit or Kundalini for example.  It is widely recorded that experiences of 'mystical union'
with the Holy Spirit and as well, experiences of Kundalini awakening are like a spark or a candle in which,
once a being is in this state -which has a particular electromagnetic frequency signatures respective to the state itself-
this state becomes then permissibly transferrable to another nearby system or 'capacitor' or human or 
'electrical-motor-engine' 
AS LONG AS
the nearby system / 'capacitor' / human / 'electrical-motor-engine' / antennae can withold the voltage long enough
to learn how to sustain it.

What do we mean by sustain it?

We say sustain it because in order for a system to continue to generate electromagnetic force over time we need to
make a kind of 'temple',
in other words we need a body made up of the kind of frequencies and materials aka chemical compositions that can 
withstand the kind of voltage we are seeking to conduct through it.  
If we would like

How do we sustain it?  The voltage can be sustained AS LONG AS the material with which the second conductor is
built is a high dielectric material and used in phi golden-ratio proportions

electrically contagious is what Dan Winter might say,

and this we call inductance (el anuncio para la familia) in electrical engineering.


Inductance is when a Second electrical generative force flow is created from a first initial flowing electrical generative
force.  The second flow is generated in correlation to it's magnetic field.

"If the very center of every system (proton, cell, human, planet, star) is a black hole, 
then how come we don't measure the "Black-Hole Scharzschild-Mass" every time we measure and analyze the energy levels of any system?"

Simply put we inquire now, 
"Why are we realizing there is exponentially more energy in every system than we may be detecting with our instruments and external senses?"

Q&A
Why is it that we measure so little of the potential energy available in any given system?
Screening - What is it

Why and how is the black hole compressing stored inertia we do not measure? 


Up until recent times there has been a kind of incongruent discrepancy in research laboratories between: 
the energy levels CALCULATED in any system
(proton, cell, star),
and
the energy levels MEASURED-FROM any system
(proton, cell, star)


Why is it that we measure so little of the potential energy available in any given system?

We come to find out now that current mainstream scientific technology has only been measuring, 
"detecting" ONLY the energy levels that a system 'radiates' electromagnetically,
not having included in their measurements the standing waves of plasma/prana/inertia that are fractally folded within the system,
produced by the black hole's gravitational spinning force of compression.

********| Harmonics in the Aura | Harmonic Inclusiveness | Circuits | Grounding and acquiring harmonics*******

What do we refer to when we talk about 'harmonics' in our bio-field {aka "aura"} and how does this affect our everday living?
i like curly braces
--
"Musical Notes"
THINK(Metaphor)IMAGINE
The quality of sound heard in every note plucked on any instrument, 
richness, dullness, brightness, flatness, fullness, lightness,
is directly a consequence of 
'how many' harmonics 
and 
'which' harmonics
-of the full spectrum of harmonics contained within the "full-version" note-
('harmonics' are the collection of frequencies constituting or 'making up' a note -see 'harmonics' in terms)
'which' harmonics are currently inhabiting 
the spectrum of the 'musical note' or frequency-signature that is currently being played in question.

As the string gets played more and more over time gradually it loses some of it's original harmonics.
We are saying this equals losing 'fullness of expression' of a note.

If the string is exposed to rain or humid air over long enough time it loses some of it's original harmonics.

Q&A
What does this mean?
How does this relate to physics
How do we regain lost harmonis?

when it loses some of it's original resonant harmonics 


Why is the subject of harmonics in bio-field "aura" (EMF) so IMPERATIVE to 'innerstand'?



~EVERYTHING IS A CIRCUIT~

Our bodies are a circuit.

"Grounding Barefoot on Soil | Tendency for an"
FEEL(Experiential)PRACTICAL
Our bodies are intended to include -earth- frequency-harmonics within its bio-field (EMF) 
Those frequency-harmonics that resonate uniquely to -earth- are known as 'schumann-frequency' harmonics, 
as Discovered thanks to edit_full_name_Schumann
the spectrum of harmonics found naturally in earth's living bio-field can be thought of as specific set of musical tones,
our body's bio-field total set of harmonics can be orchestra

Our bodies are analagous to a guitar string. 

"Guitar Strings"
THINK(Metaphor)IMAGINE
-The guitar string is NOT the note.- 
What does this mean?
What are we saying by this>?

This may not seem obvious to some.
The guitar string is not the note being played,
it is -The Carrier-;
It may be poetically likened to a messenger,
or 'one who invokes a message'
The messenger is NOT the message.
The message in this case is the note.
Where does the message originally come from?

You see how this is leading us to now walking into 'field' theory 
or what Pythagoras called the "Ringing of the Spheres"
for there can be no messenger without message,
That is to say,
When we play a guitar 


The string is analogous to 'our body' resonating at its 'current' state.
We say 'current' because the string can decay a bit over time to environmental conditions including playing,
therefore
our 

The ratios / 'proportional difference' 
between 
the harmonics found in our 'current' field  -you could call the body- -the guitar string that is

(like an 'A' note or 'C#' in it's FULLEST SOUND)
determines 
the sound heard 
such as richness, dullness, brightness, flatness, fullness, lightness.

The spiritual nature of this is such that one may derive one's current feeling of -wholeness-

We can gain missing harmonics by receiving echo's of them from the larger fields

How is this so?
Let me explain

Everything is an open system, (see "Open System concept in Infinite/Finite ")
and as such, 
when we 'inhabit a field',
the harmonics present in that field are resonating or 'echoing' at all times
