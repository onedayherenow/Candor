"To fully see and feel and appreciate a forest, one first sees and feels a metal city"

"To fully know the truth, one must first face that which has kept one from the truth"


This journey {to integrate and harness the spirituality of physics} starts right off with reviewing
the shocking history that led to the fundamental errors, assumptions, missing pieces and ad-hoc 'patches' used to cover
longstanding holes upon which standard physics has been built and publically taught in most schools.

By playing the role of detective and taking a fun walkthrough through a few historically-defining moments of Science,
we examine together what led to the turning points which created the defining errors that have stalled our public unification of physics.

The following are independant individual contributions, events and circumstances reviewed in logical light of the historical time-period
in which they occurred so as to inner'stand their frame of mind and how they came to affect both our Sciences and our Spirituality. 

I want to brace any readers who are going to be learning about this for their first time.
I say this because the following information can be heart-breaking, sad, and/or even maddening at first, 
kind of like when we were children then grew up to find out that certain things adults said were 'real' were actually 'made up' by them.
This story follows this dynamic except,
rest assured there is a light at the end of the tunnel, 
and not just a light,
to be a bit more revealing there is a whole world at the end of the tunnel that our Science is just now catching up to..



We begin our investigation at one of the main roots of where it all started...  James Clerk Maxwell, father of Electromagnetism.

To be clear, in standard physics as taught publically there are 4 forces: Electromagnetism, Gravity, the Strong Force, and the Weak Force.

(We will unify these 4 forces into one single model a bit later on, for now we are reviewing famous mistakes, the effects of which 
humanity is still dealing with and recovering from as a whole)



James Clerk Maxwell is known for having written the original equations which describe electricity, magnetism, and light 
together in an engineerable way.  








Our next character entering into our play review here is none other than Albert Einstein himself.
