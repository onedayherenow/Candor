"To fully see and feel and appreciate a forest, one first sees and feels a metal city"

"To fully know the truth, one must first face that which has kept one from the truth"


This journey {to integrate and harness the spirituality of physics} starts right off with reviewing
the shocking history that led to the fundamental errors, assumptions, missing pieces and ad-hoc 'patches' used to cover
longstanding holes upon which standard physics has been built and publically taught in most schools.

By playing the role of detective and taking a fun walkthrough through a few historically-defining moments of Science,
we examine together what led to the turning points which created the defining errors that have stalled our public unification of physics.

The following are independant individual contributions, events and circumstances reviewed in logical light of the historical time-period
in which they occurred so as to inner'stand their frame of mind and how they came to affect both our Sciences and our Spirituality. 

I want to brace any readers who are going to be learning about this for their first time.
I say this because the following information can be heart-breaking, sad, and/or even maddening at first, 
kind of like when we were children then grew up to find out that certain things adults said were 'real' were actually 'made up' by them.
This story follows this dynamic except,
rest assured there is a light at the end of the tunnel, 
and not just a light,
to be a bit more revealing there is a whole world at the end of the tunnel that our Science is just now catching up to..



We begin our investigation at one of the main roots of where it all started...  James Clerk Maxwell, father of Electromagnetism.

To be clear, in standard physics as taught publically there are 4 forces: Electromagnetism, Gravity, the Strong Force, and the Weak Force.

(We will unify these 4 forces into one single model a bit later on, for now we are reviewing famous mistakes, the effects of which 
humanity is still dealing with and recovering from as a whole)



James Clerk Maxwell is known for having written the original equations describing electricity, magnetism, and light 
together as one, all in an engineerable way.

For context, Einstein's theory of relativity describes gravity however does not include electromagnetism in the theory, 
and thus it was not unified as he could not find the bridge between these two: electromagnetism and gravity.
This is grave, we shall see why (surprise, it goes all the way back to Maxwell)

Maxwell is a fascinating fellow and, although there is much justice we could do in writing a biographical account of his life and
we both almost share the same birthday, we are only looking at what ended up happening to his contributions to Physics: 
most notably his set of Quaternion equations written in 1864 and today simply called "Maxwell's Equations."

To simplify what we have just introduced about Maxwell's equations,	lets just say for now:
Maxwell's Equations 
- Written in quaternions
- Describe the behavior of electricity, magnetism, light, and 'scalar' waves as parts originating from one unified field
(we will go into more detail on scalar waves and how this name is interchangeable with the name gravity waves)
- Scalar waves are a kind of wave-component in the field which 'squeezes', 'compresses', 'spins' and/or 'changes density'


What is most remarkable about these set of equations is that not only together were they the first conceptual model describing
electricity magnetism and light as 'one',
but that they also included the concept of 'scalar waves' which we will talk about are what makes up gravity waves,
and that they even included the concept of 'fields' in general and introduced the universal medium that today we call
- Ether / Quantum Vacuum / Zero-Point Field - all interchangable words.

This is monumental as we shall see.


	For example in Maxwell's papers:
*When Maxwell writes about "the medium", he is referring to the universal fluid-like medium in space 
which over time has come to be called the Ether, through which light travels.
Also when he writes about a 'stress in the medium', the 'stress tensor' as he calls it in his papers is precisely 
a scalar wave he is talking about.


Scalar waves are not electromagnetic light radiation and yet they form the initial gravitational conditions
which lead to corresponding electromagnetic affects.


So far you may be thinking, "okay well it looks like Maxwell got a whole lot of unification accomplished, 
what are we still doing here and what does this all have to say to Spirituality?"

We are on the same page, and what is a good story without an unexpected curveball severely affecting generations and technology in 
150 years that has come since then?

Well life says we got that for you and the curveball's name is called Oliver Heaviside editing and re-writing Maxwell's papers
to what came to be known as the "Heaviside's Vector Calculus version of Maxwell's Equations".
Excuse me?

For what follows we need a bit more context!, that is to say 
remember there were no calculators at this time so all equations were always worked out manually.

It turns out, quaternions were quite a load to work on without a calculator in the mid-late 1800's, and so meet Oliver Heaviside.
Maxwell passed away in 1879, and just a few years later in 1884 a man by the name of Oliver Heaviside came and
took the original set of Maxwell's equations, 20 quaternion equations, and he re-wrote it all into 4 Vector Equations.
The equations were edited from quaternions into vector calculus.

The equations were much quicker to calculate without a calculator however they were a sterilized version of the original
because the scalar-wave component was completely removed... 
yes engineers were much happier that they could calculate electromagnetic behavior faster this way, 
and as we know convenience can breed complacency...
What happened soon after Maxwell's passing away and Heaviside's re-writing of Maxwell's equations was that 
the standard equations describing electricity and magnetism for electrical engineers and physicists became
Heaviside's version of Maxwell's equations.

This would be like someone taking one of Leonardo Davinci's oil paintings and saying,
"Oil paints take way too long to dry, lets use crayon they're faster" and recreating it in crayons and then calling the 
crayon-colored one the official artpiece taught in schools and universities.

Uh-oh... lets look at that again, scary but needs attention.
This came but at a cost.

To re-state and be clear here,
the problem is that you cannot represent the Quaternion-scalar-wave component using Vector Calculus so he LEFT IT OUT.
That seemingly small detail came to be a gateway to deeply far-reaching issues that arose from this,
not just in electrical engineering and physics but also including our inner'standing of reality
and our quest to know the Spiritual nature of Creation.


Without the scalar-wave component, the following are impossible to describe or accomplish: 

- Describing the origin of electromagnetism
- Describing the connecting link between electromagnetism and gravity
- Describing how the gravitational field and electromagnetic field interact with each other
- Describing how one can extract gravitational energy from the field and use it electromagnetically

Said another way in Spiritual Terms,
Without the scalar-wave component, the following are impossible to describe or accomplish: 

- Describing the origin of that which we see, hear, touch, taste, smell and perceive with 'external senses'
- Describing the connecting link between the 'physical dimension of matter' of the body 
	and the 'non-physical spiritual dimension' of the soul, emotions, mind
- Describing how the 'non-physical spiritual dimension' interacts with the 'physical dimension of matter'
- Describing how one can extract 'Spiritual Energy' (prana, chi, life-force) from the space around us and use it
in our 'Physical World'





Before we make our way to the climax of the Maxwell story and how his original unified
look at how Maxwells not just later edited, 

First what do the equations describe exactly?
Next, what are Quaternions.


To see the magnitude of what his equations originally meant and how they echo a principle of universal oneness,
hese equations described


today's standard academic physics does not have

Little is it known that Maxwell also included gravitation into his original equations.  Where?
We will see where



Our next character entering into our play review here is none other than Albert Einstein himself.
