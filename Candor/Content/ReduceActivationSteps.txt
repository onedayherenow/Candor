MINIMAL ACTIVATION STEPS

The most important step in designing the right environment is to reduce activation energy, i.e., 
the number of steps you need to take to act on the desired behavior. In the case of developing a daily writing habit, 
the following four steps are the necessary activation energy:

Find something to write with
Find Something to Write on
Decide where you want to write
Decide how long you will write
You can reduce activation energy by doing the following: 

Choose what you want to write the night before
Decide in advance what you will need: a computer, notebook, etc.
Select a place where you write in advance.
Set up all your writing tools the night before. If you’re using a computer, open a Word document or a 
distraction-free command prompt so that it’s the first thing you see when you open the laptop. The goal is to eliminate 
as many steps between you and the desired action as possible. Although these activities may seem small, 
the fewer steps between you and your desired habit, the more likely you are to perform the habit.
