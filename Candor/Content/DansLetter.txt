INTRODUCTION FOR LETTER TO DAN WHEN I PRESENT THIS BOOK
"Dan, 
I was thinking of your collegues down memory lane as waves converging heterodying,
you've talked about all problems in physics relating to the perfect compression device,,,  I wanted to say you may have
accomplished this through heterodyning their waves, conjugating their work with your own unique inertia
and frame of reference, allowing for the result to be greater than the sum of their parts,
preserving the momentum of their teachings and multiplying their fractal implications by abiding in the integrity of your 
golden ratio love and bliss throughout the journey"
