I am writing a book titled "Universal Oneness: The Spiritual Nature of Physics" 
in which we unify science and spirituality 
This has a few steps

Throughout the book we continually ask 3 things 
1."What are the fundamental principles?" 
2."How do we think about this (using relatable metaphors to understand conceptuallly)"
3."How do we feel this directly in our lives concretely (real life experiential examples)"
 
The order in which we proceed through the book is as follows:
First, 
in order to present a unified model of physics which accounts not only for previously
already accounted-for everyday phenomena like the birth of stars, orbit of planets and the
stability of atomic elements, 
but that also accounts for spiritual/mental/emotional phenomena like the process of falling in love,
talking to angels, telepathy, prayer, goosebumps when listening to amazing music, 
the feeling of inspiration, meditation, the human aura, chakras, and so on,
-all in physics terms-,
then,
the process sequence in this book is as follows:
We cannot reform something if we do not know what has led to the need for it's reformation,
After that, we see what and why needs reformed and we can extract a new accurate model based
on observational patterns of consistent evidence:  


1. First we 
Review the standard un-unified incomplete ad hoc mainstream physics as taught in public schools 
- the gaping holes and incomplete theory of classical mainstream newtonian physics 
as taught in public schools is examined: 
We illuminate the path that their logical assumptions took in the light of the historical context 
at the time at which those assumptions were made which led to erroneous incomplete physics so as to 
understand where they were coming from:
We examine the incongruent holes and fudge factors
(fudge factor is a term for 'ad-hoc' values arbitrarily thrown in to compensate for 'missing' values 
that mainstream physicists have been missing and couldn't figure out why they were missing that
or where they come from)

for example: In mainstream public school classical physics,
Both 'Dark Matter' and the 'Strong Force' are ad-hoc fudge factor values that were thrown in 
arbitrarily into mainstream standard physics, each for a different reason which I will explain now
below briefly just to illustrate how universally important and relevant this is to all schools:

(Strong Force) In physics, historically when physicists were discovering chemical elements such as 
silver, zinc, oxygen, chlorine, and saw that all the positively charged protons were tightly compressed 
into a proton-nucleus-center without repelling each other (as normally opposites attract and we get into why),
they knew some force was holding them compressed inwardly and Literally Just Threw IN that missing value
needed to hold the protons together into their equations and arbitrarily called that force the 'Strong Force'
(which in itself, forgive me, is a childish unimaginative name) 
When In reality, 
what is not taught in schools is that the missing value for the force holding the protons together in the 
nucleus is no other than gravity acting at the atomic scale instead of a mysterious strong force, 
(which currently in standard mainstream physics there is no theory of gravity at the atomic scale
and instead, gravity is only a part of general relativity theory as developed by Einstein that is relevant
at large scales like celestial objects/planets/stars,
and for smaller phenomena like atoms/subatomic-particles there is a SEPERATE unconnected set of physics 
called Quantum Mechanics , and General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are considered distinct and different,
(..as if nature made seperate physics for small things and big things overlooking the fact that
'big' things are made up of 'small things', not too mention big and small are only relevant to each other)
and not only that!, but
in mainstream standard physics there is no analytical solution for gravity (I know hard to believe but
it is only derived from einstein field equation mathematics as an equivalence formula, 
not as an analytical description about what causes gravity, 
for example they say gravity is a result of mass bending space-time but they
do not define the origin of mass or even the topology of an atom correctly (they think atoms are
solid things like billiard balls but in reality they are regions of space where the space/ether/plasma 
self-organizes into and expresses itself in that region as 
a coherent unified spinning torus shape form dynamic 
wherever there is a gradient in density in the space/ether/plasma,
the same way a tornado (mass) is born where there is first a gradient in air pressure (space gradient),
the same way a star is born where there is first a black whole (plasma toroid due to plasma gradient) 
in both and all cases exhibiting the quality of polarity expressed as:
north and south poles like the earth, 
positive and negative charge like an atom, 
north and south mouths like a vortex tornado.
(we define not only the origin of mass in the book but also how to produce mass out of space by
spinning the ether/space itself using pressure differentials in a high dielectric medium 
to produce voltage from gravity)

when in reality 
 
there is ONE UNIFIED FIELD where the wave mechanics for 
gravity at the quantum/atomic scale are the same for black holes at the relativistic macro scale,
and this quantum gravity is occuring due to the black holes that mainstream science has overlooked 
constitute the center of every negentropic system from the quantum scale all the way to relativistic macro scale
and black hole dynamics at any scale are equivalently producing gravitational effects at that same scale
and region in space/time
(in the book we share and describe
the wave mechanics for how gravity occurs in any black hole system due to acceleration of inertia towards center
due to fractal-symmetry of the vector line geometry of charge propogation in any system 
enabled by phi/golden-ratio wave harmonic geometry >--

(visualize a 3D sphere with perfect self-repeating dodecahadral fractal geometric grid within it's inside volume
like we find in the element of mono-atomic gold, 
and along the vector lines on the edges of this geometric grid
is the path along which energy/information/charge/electricity travels, which when it travels in this kind of 
geometry, information/energy becomes SUPERCONDUCTIVE and begins to implode the charge/information/energy 
TOWARDS CENTER while spinning because the fractal symmetry across any node in a geometric grid means that 
charge can continue to propogate wherever the path of propogation continues self-symmetrical in it's
respective geometry in relation to the whole,  
and in any system, the direction in which charge propogates is either IN our OUT
centrifugally in the form of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION (like photon emissions or like speaking and praying) 
or centripetally in the form of GRAVITATIONAL FORCES (like longitudinal interferometry or like listening and meditating),
and so when charge implodes centrifugally towards center, it can accelerate charge in the form of
gravity towards center if the waves implode constructively like they do only perfected in phi ratio relationships.
AND SO
this is why mono-atomic gold does not burn in fire(burning would be entropy) as it is purely fractal in atomic geometry 
and therefore Negentropic, 
thus like it says in the Bible, 
true faith really is like gold that is tested by fire in the form of tribulations...
Or as Dan Winter might put it, only Pure Intention survives
-->
which is the only ratio which allows ALL WAVES that cross each other to Not Only Add but also Multiply
each respective inertial velocity together CONSTRUCTIVELY instead of Desctructively which means that 
their momentum is not only preserved but multiplied in velocity as it moves towards center, 
and thus we increase gravitational pull towards center the closer you get to center,
while spinning at the same time like for instance in planet orbitals or electron clouds around a nucleus 
because space/space-time (which we call the Ether/Vacuum/Space) is spinning 
itself in the shape of a torus vortex like a hurricane always and wherever in space that there is 
a gradient in density like a 'cold front' meeting a 'warm front' creates spin like a tornado except in our
example here the cold front is dense centripetal plasma and the warm front is expansive centrifugal plasma.

The book then shares how we rectify the old outdated standard model by introducing Quantum Gravity and Black Hole physics 
as well as
quantizing the ether/space/vacuum with spherical planck units as Nassim Haramein has modeled to
very straight-forwardly get the black hole 



and reality shaking this is, seeing as gravity and
physics constitute reality as we know it.
