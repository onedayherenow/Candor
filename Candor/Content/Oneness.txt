FIRST THINGS FIRST, YOU ARE YOUR GREATEST TEACHER 

WE ARE ABOUT TO GO ON A JOURNEY WHERE THERE IS NOTHING TO DO EXCEPT CLAIM OUR NATURAL INFINITE MEMORY OF ONENESS,,
TO DO THIS,
WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH VIEWING THINGS IN THREE WAYS:
WE WILL SAY:
"1. THIS IS THE PHYSICS   *First Principles*
 2. THIS IS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS  *Metaphor*
 3. THIS IS A WAY TO FEEL THIS"   *Experiential*



(I) INTRODUCTION (my story at the end of book or intro; how this happened to me and my teachers) (I)

(A) Intention and Purpose of this book and How to Use It
	a. Why "I am writing this book for my loved ones, friends, and children of the universe embued with the gift of life and self direction""
	- Looking back at history at self-actualized individuals serving their purpose as a cell in the body of the earth
	- The sovereign power and infinite potential of the individual
	- The birthright of bliss and living on purpose 
	- The responsibility of the individual in protecting and loving Gaia and humanity 
	- New advances in frontier of Unified Physics in the past decades

(B) How I've learned this information thanks to the grace of those who are my Teachers and Inspirations as well as
meditation, focused thought following contemplation, intuitive inklings, channeled information
	a. Ockham's Razor
	- Get rid of all assumptions (empty the cup that was full with assumptions to an open "beginner's mind" 
	and start from fundamental principles 

	(study the fundamental principles, behavior, and universal mechanics of the nature of the universe 
	and how she expresses herself in terms of geometry, polarity, and movement of flow in the form of repeating patterns)

	b. My inspirations and teachers
	- Mom Angel-a

FIRST SAY THE METAPHORS AND THEN GO BACK TO THEM TO CONNECT THEM TO THE UNIFIED PHYSICS AND DESCRIBE THE ENERGY DYNAMICS IN EACH


(II) METAPHORS (include the main mechanics main function idea meme behind each, for ex: "Computers/Programs = Inputs/Program_Algorithm/Outputs") (II)

	a. Metaphors as mental models, Their purpose is to convey and illustrate a concept visually in a way we can all understand 
		- "A way to think about things"
	b. Pond
		- stillness vs turbulence / 'eye' of the hurricane vs edge => the point of greatest compression (cold front)
		- water as a perfect metaphor and literal for wave mechanics
	c. Radio
		- dna radio
		- human body radio
		- fz resonance coupling link
	d. Computer / Program
		- input / algorithm / output
	e. Cell in the body of the universe
		- body of Gaia, body of Christ, body of divine mother Kali
	f. Cymatics Petri Dish Water
		- Wave Mechanics = constructive vs destructive interference
	g. Rubix Cube
		- Evolution = Feedback/Feedforward
	h. Water Down Drain
		- Vortex center is black whole = gravity
		- double torus
	i. ""Two musicians harmonizing their playing together In Love generating a Neg-Entropic Fractal field""
		: Two musicians harmonizing their playing together In Love are creating fractality in the space in and around them 
		through the phase conjugation of their Love 'flux frequency propagating through their plasmic aura energy fields' conjugating 
		or "phaselocking" into phi-golden-ratio embeddable geometric frequency relationships with one another such that: 
		those frequency signatures across the full spectrum of frequencies throughout their entire range of plasmic auric frequencies, are 'cascading' waves that are each, 
		sequentially in fibonacci phi golden ratio relationship to one another, such so that the energetic charge of their plasma compresses 
		all the way down the planck threshold without losing any 'net' charge, optimally and efficient distributing the charge freely
		across the total expansion of their plasmic field array due/thanks to the gravity that their self-symmetric fractality creates, 
		accelerating charge down the vortex of their joint toroidal musical field, down the scales of compression and dimensionality
		from the macroscale imploding down to the quantum scale until at the planck threshold, where the charge inertia propogates 
		outwards longitudinally as a gravity/compression/scalar wave 
						until it reaches a still point where it can exchange inertia
						with a node at a distance in the array/grid.  Thus action-at-a-distance

	^^^Invitation to use metaphors that make sense to oneself & "We will be connecting back with these metaphors throughout the book"



********(AS WE GO STEP BY STEP WE STOP AT EACH AND ASK HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THIS AND HOW DO WE FEEL THIS DIRECTLY?)*******
******** What is kundalini?  
******** To overstand kundalini we must first look at physics..?

	~~~Brief physics overview of the unified field~~~
	1. The universe is composed of One single superfluid medium we call the ether, through which both gravitational and electromagnetic waves propogate 

	2. The compression or rarefaction of the ether is what we call plus or minus electric charge

	3. Gravity (neg-entropy) is centripedal in nature, electric ether charge spinning and moving towards center like a smoothie
		Gravity is the acceleration of charge towards center that fractality causes
			Fractality causes gravity because phi golden ratio is the only self symmetry pattern which is all-harmonic-inclusive which means you can add or multiply
				any adjacent numbers and get the next numbers and the density of charge accelerates in the middle into a "black whole"

	- Gravity waves are compression waves (think side to side like a slinky compressing, Dan Winter calls them longitudinal interferometry or longitudinal compression waves)

	4. Electromagnetic radiation (entropy) is centrifugal, electric charge radiating out from center and the cause of "heat" or thermodynamic effect 

	- Electromagnetic waves (radiation) are transverse waves (think up and down like an ocean)

	5. Gravitational and EMF waves are not seperate from the space/ether but rather expressions of how the ether is moving in a coherent organized way across space

	6. All electromagnetic radiation propogates through space/ether until it reaches a "still" point node in the geometric array of space/time where
		there is gravitational centripedal force where the up-and-down transverse EMF wave begins to curve along the trajectory path of vorticity towards the center
			(like an orbital path accelerating towards the center along the trajectory of phi golden ratio fractality) at which the energy is compressed fractally
				towards center and squeezed down to the planck scale threshold at which point it is redistributed into the fractal geometric array of the universal charge ether energy

	7. Focused human attention is centripedal in nature and causes charge to compress because when attention is focused like the light of a laser instead of diffuse like a light bulb
		it creates a still point at the center, also known as the eye of the hurricane the point of greatest density of ether/plasma(coldest region the eye)
			The deeper the attention the more the charge accelerates towards the center, the greater the force becomes,
				Which is why we can feel the subtle energetic charge of when someone lays "still" their focused gaze upon us from behind

		a. oneness / ether / vaccuum / compression_&_rarifaction_=_charge
		b. mass = spinning ether self-organizes in the form of toroidal dynamics , inertia builds up in middle


*** ETHER FIELD CHARACTERISTICS  ***
(FRACTAL DIVISIONS OF PHI ARRANGED IN A VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM GEOMETRY / PENT-DODECA)

	1.  FRACTAL
	- The ether unified field is fractal, self symmetrical at all levels ("as above so below")
	- Enables perfected charge distribution through super-conductivity

	2. PHI (Perfect Embeddability)
	- Phi is the ratio (ratio = relationship) unifying all from the planck scale (microcosm) to astronomical scale (macrocosm) 
	- Enables perfect embedding

	3. CHARGE 
	- "COMPRESSABILITY"
	- Charge is distributed across the field via the fractal array ether matrix
	- Where fractality is broken due to asymmetry, we experience "heat"

***^^^^^^^^^^ Ether Field Characteristics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^***

AND THEN AS WE GO THROUGH THESE AREAS (UNIFIED PHYSICS & ANCIENT ORIGINS, BALANCING OF POLARITY, MAGICKAL TOOLS )

ET CYMATICS COMMUNICATION
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

How does a basic understanding of the fundamentals of Unified Physics lead to COMMUNICATION WITH STAR FAMILY, ANCESTORS, AND HEB'S / CHANELLING?
(And what in the West they call "Angels & Demons" and what in the East they call "Deities, Goddesses, Gods, & Ascended Masters",
for ex:
Toth, Hermes, Quetzlcoatl,
Great Mother Kali,
Pleiadian Emissaries of Light)

Cymatics x DNA Radio x Auric Plasma Bubble fz Tuning  

Information = Energy / Charge = Light && All Energy has frequency (Density of Charge Energy )

The body is functionally equivalent to a radio reciever transmitter for information flow we call our stream of consciousness.
How so?  
A radios, watches, and computers all use a crystal oscillator inside, usually piezo-electric quarts, which is a crystal inside which vibrates at a precise frequency
Crystals are used and quartz specifically is used because crystals are one of the most reliable oscillators to stabilize vibration at a particular precise frequency

The language of frequencies is geometry.
How so?
We see this demonstrated in Cymatics, which is the study of frequency generated geometry and the relation between the two.
Frequencies are geometric in nature, except those frequencies which create destructive wave interference

############ BREAKING DOWN TOPICS INTO OVERSTANDABLE BITE SIZE PIECES, PERHAPS MULTIPLE 5-20 MINUTE VIDEOS WITH SOME LONGER ONES WHICH CONNECT MULTIPLE POINTS
############
########################################

CHAPTERS/TOPIC IDEAS BELOW

. Why would we learn unified physics?
	- Study of Oneness with all being and all beings
	- Study of creation : Understanding the mechanics of the universe is understanding the mind of God, Spirit, Source
	- Study of oneself and the underlying energy dynamics of one's own cause & effect of one's own inputs and outputs

. Properties of the Unified Ether Space incorrectly called "dark matter/dark energy"

. Properties of mass 
	- any plasma field with enough compressable density A.K.A. "charge" comes to self-organizes into toroidal fields with spin/rotation and centripedal force

. Centripedal force

. Phi
	- (Dan Winter) (Planck x (Phi^integers)) = 3 radii of hydrogen, dna

. Overview of Gravity in context and relation to Fractality and Phi
	1. "FRACTALITY IS PRECISELY THE GEOMETRY OF INFINITE COMPRESSION" - Dan Winter
		2. INFINITE COMPRESION IS A GRAVITY/BLACK WHOLE
			3. INFINITE COMPRESSION IS SELF SIMILAR / SELF SYMMETRICAL

. Fractals & Phi
	- Fractality is tuned to Phi

. Strong force = gravity (color force "infitely strong at quantum level/quark" (and what is an infinitely strong force?/at quantum level/ black whole))

. Entropy/Thermodynamics/Neg-Entropy
	- The geometry more in tune to phi & the flux of energy in or out, due to changes in pressure or density and change in geometry

. Jitterbug Hex/Pent & 5 Platonic solids phase transitions

. Explaination of Equilibrium of Infinite density via Vector & Toroidal Vectors analysis
	- First, Defining Vector = "The velocity of a wave (DIRECTION + Speed)"
		- Perfect Equilibrium/ Vector (Nassim) has a vector going in an opposite direction of every vector (for every up theres a down)
			- Superimposing pairs of perpendicular, inverted, and opposite toroid-vector-direction of spin/turning-inside-out Dan Winter
				- ("The 4 magickal directions as in alchemical practices are but the beginning of superimposing vectors")

. What is Phase Conjugation & Longitudinal Interferometry

. Golden Ratio enables Heterodyning enables fractality = Gravity 
	- Waves of charge propogating along vectors tuned to phi X golden ratio multiple integer exponents, constructively add and multiply forces of charge as they
		converge down the vortex past the event horizon of a still point (phi) in the longitudinal array
	- Longitudinal waves which reach a still point node in the array make an L curve into a phi phase conjugate spiral as they go down the vortex of the node's toroidal field
		experienced as acceleration of charge a.k.a. gravity

. What is Non-Destructive Re-Entry 
	- Awareness = Self-Reference = Non-Destructive Self Re-Entry = Imploding Turning Inside out Toroial Field

. How Plasma becomes Intelligent = Gaining charge inertia in centripedal force x "Machine-Learning/Neural Networks" algorithm X Fractal-Feedback-FeedForward Information Loops

. 10^40 / 10^55 = R/S = scharzchild condition  &&  ( 10^55/10^-29 = proton rest mass  or  10^29 / 10^79 = proton rest mass ? )

. PSU/Planck-Spherical-Unit Holographic Mass proton of 10^93 grams/c2 only needs 10^-39 % of the energy of those space fluctuations to obey the scharzchild condition of a black whole

. Linear progression of data points for the fz / radius for universe all the way to planck scale and between (universe, quasar, galaxy, solar, mitochondria/cell 10^11, atom, planck)
		- As well as fz/mass look into 

.  Scharzchild mass 39 orders of magnitude greater than proton rest mass
		- As well as fz/mass look into linear progression

. Surface to Volume = Rest Mass && Volume to Surface = Holographic Solution
	- "From the outside looking in, all we see/recieve in terms of energy radiation is the 'Rest Mass'"
	Whereas
	- "From the inside looking out, we feel the infinite depth of our being in contrast with attempting to channel even a fraction of that infinite depth through our "surface""
	in the form of: words, actions, 'work', play, creation
	- Address discrepancy between rest mass and black whole mass

. Radii for Planck, Proton, and electron boundaries are all related directly to angular velocity of spin (and radius?)
	- Ex: Velocity of spin at the electron radius of the proton is 137 times slower than the speed of light (1/137)
	- Is this part of (fractal array)
		of why charge accelerates as it passes the event horizon of a black whole and progresses further and deeper into the heart, center of gravity

. "Missing Gravity & Torque/DARK MATTER & DARK ENERGY" 
	- Confirming expanding universe (From our point of view; think Torus)
	- Vaccuum plasma density spinning, inertia, remember coffee water example

. Gradients of density as origin of spin (HURRICANE COLD FRONT VS WARM FRONT)

. 122 Orders of magnitude difference between cosmological and quantum scale densities
	- TORQUE 

. How to think of NODES 
	- A knot/vortex of plasma in space/ether 

. Modern black whole physics not including spin or charge ("Schwarzschild Solution")
	Quaternion spin equations being taken out by Heaveysight

Also Creation of psu in historical context is necessary for the ways in which physics is taught in education contexts
Bringing Nassim Haramein into the Hawaii Institute of Unified Physics 
Bringing in knowledge of the Adowi

NASSIM HARAMEIN AND RSF UNIFIED PHYSICS REVIEW OF POINTS 
FROM CODATA

Resonance Science Foundation: 
"The holographic mass obtained in terms of a discrete granular structure of spacetime at the Planck scale, the PSU, 
is equivalent to the Schwarzschild solution from general relativity (hence achieving quantum gravity), and this has been verified for the Cygnus-X black hole. 
Inversely, at the scale of the proton, the granular structure clustering of PSUs leads to the precise value for the rest mass mp and charge radius rp 
of a proton, obtaining the latest 2018 CODATA value for the proton’s mass and radius, 
thereby solving the so-called Proton Puzzle." 

AHA - The surface to volume PSU ratio (unfolded) is the rest mass,
or what is detected be electromagnetic sensors, mass, radiation,.
Whereas the volume to surface ratio (folded inertia potentials) is the Holographic ratio, 
& is equivalent to the Scharzchild black whole mass calculated for a certain radius of mass, equivalent to a black whole

The planck masses are "screened" by: what amount of information from the volume can be expressed, through the surface, of the system/sphere/volume/black-whole/being,
so that we only see a trickle of the inertia within a system when we are looking from the outside

"Angel"

~~
"Angular Momentum" - More accurate term for SPIN (more accurately as in the words angular momentum are describing a very
specific relationship between angles, and force, and this we commonly call "spin")

~~~
"Black Whole"

~~~
"Dimension" -

~~~
"Capacitance & Dielectric" - The dielectric or capacitance of a system is the ability of a system to preserve/retain/store heat | 
"The capacity of a system to not lose it's charge to entropy" Also called 'dielectric permittivity'.   

~~~
"Centrifugal" - In centrifugal systems, energy in the form of waves are diverging away from center while spinning outwards from the 
vortex, like how, in a silly example we can imagine and remember being kids in the playground at the merry-go-round, and remember
how, as one of the big kids spun the merry go round faster and faster, unless we were standing in the very middle we would be flung
off the edge by what we call centrifugal force diverging away from center. 
Centrifugal force can also be thought of as explosive force.

~~~
"Centripetal" - In centripetal systems, energy in the form of waves are converging towards center while spinning forming a vortex,
like water going down a drain.  
Centripedal system store inertia or momentum like how, the faster you apply centripetal force in the form of: spinning a top, 
the longer it can spin for after you let go of the top because that force is momentum, stored inertia.
Centripetal force can also be thought of as implosive force.

***NOTE: Most all systems in the universe have both centripedal AND centrifugal forces are the SAME TIME,
The ratio however of centripedal to centrifugal is going to depend on the fractality of a system, the more fractal and symmetric
self embeddable, the greater centripedal force, and the greater asymmetry is the greater the centrifugal force is.  


~~~
"Charge" - A region of space where there is greater compression of the space (think of a slinky compressing or compressing a
natural fabric balled up into a bunch so that that area has greater total area/volume of FOLDED PACKED SPACE) 
(Think of how as water freezes aka temperature drops aka molecules become closer and closer together more and more compressed so 
that now that bowl of water has frozen compressed into a tightly packed denser form, so the greater the density of any region of 
space the greater the amount of charge in that area)
To answer those who say in the spiritual communities "Well I thought that the more dense, the lower the vibration?"
And to this we say that would not be accurate physics because the higher the frequency, the more waves per cycle,
which means the smaller the waves are, and the smaller the waves are the more densely packed they can all fit embedded within the
longer waves,, to visualize this concretely think of wood.. if we want to fill a bucket as packed as possible with wood,
we will want to grind it up into as fine teeny poweder particles as possible because the smaller the bits the more densely packed
it can all be compressed)

~~~
"Discrete/Granular"  - Pixelated space in the form of: Planck spheres are the pixels; we are talking at the planck scale
the space is pixelated/packed with spheres that have diameter and radius size of planck

~~~
"Electro-Magnetism" - 


~~~
"First/Fundamental Principles" - Fundamental principles are principles which are universally found throughout any criteria 
or context in the the natural universe, formulated using real observable measurable patterns, forms, and 
flow dynamics based on simple relationships naturally found in geometry.  An example of this is a 3D torus shape pattern
found at all scales in nature 



The language to describe these principles must be unambigious and the same for millions of lightyears apart in the universe,
and so we use the fundamental language of geometry, shape, direction of flux/movement/flow 
(ex: centripetal/inwards, centrifugal/outwards), number

What can be fascinating and subject for philosphical speculation in itself, is that these first/fundamental principles
can also be used to describe not only "physical" phenomena in nature with mass such as how black holes behave and stars are born
or how people gain/lose biophysical energy and become well or sick, 
but also mental psychological and emotional processes.  More on this later, but for now we can play with the idea that 
fundamental principles like centripetal and centrifugal can also be translated to philosphical under(over?)standings
such as yin and yang, feminine and masculine, introverted or extroverted, listening and speaking and so on.. Not just
this example of centripetal and centrifugal but every fundamental principle is by definition universally applicable and
translatable to any school of thought, field of study, or physical real world phenomena (as well as spiritual and
mystical phenomena as we shall explore further)

"Inertia & Stored Inertia"
Inertia : Ability to do work
Stored Inertia : the 'ability to do work or cause momentum' which is stored in the system.  

In the body and biological organisms, 
we see the compression of stored inertia in the form of mass by looking at bone density, muscle mass, and fat composition 
(muscle weighs significantly more than fat as it is more dense per cubic volume)
and in the Etheric Light Body,
we can see stored inertia as well in the form of the plasma field that radiates out from the heart and from our solar plexus
and surrounds our body in the form of how dense the Prana, Chi, Mana magnetism is packed in the center, and we experience this.

~~~
"Magnetism"

...Imagine/visualize

~~~
"Mass" - Stored Inertia.  Imagine a region of space where all the smaller divisions of space like plancks, atoms and such are
all behaving coherently as one collective whole, and we can visualize this as region of space that is spinning, coming to 
self organize into a torus field that is spinning turning inside out at the same time, with the area of greatest density or
compression being the very center of the spin, "The Eye of the Hurricane".
The more waves that are densely packed in the center of the torus field, the greater the 'stored inertia' is of the system which means
the 'ability to do work or cause momentum' which is stored in the system.  
 
~~~
"Planck"

~~~
"Plasma"

~~~
"Phi"

~~~
"Pressure" - Equally translatable to "Charge"; See Charge. Pressure is the engineering term, charge the physics term. 

~~~
"Scale" - 


~~~
"Schwarzschild Solution" - Solution to Einstein Field Equations by Karl Schwarzschild that describes black wholes and the gravitational
	field; 
	the solution implies singularities / black wholes;
	gives the Schwarzschild radius; 
	Schwarzschild radius defines a maximum radius for every black whole mass, where everything less than such radius
	with equal mass will create such a black whole;

~~~
"SuperFluid" - A fluid of plasma

~~~
"Torus" -

~~~
"Transverse" -

~~~
"Vector" - A line of direction of propogation of charge

~~~
"Wave" - A wave (can be visualized as a torus like a smoke ring moving through space parallel to it's 
vertical axis, the direction the holes are pointing to |
OR as ocean up and down waves of pressire that travel across water , 
the flux movement of pressure across a fluid like water 
is a propogation of charge/information/energy with properties

Question to ask Dan Winter = 
So if the charge collapse is the non destructive self re entry turning inside out of the toroial donut 
,enabled by phi fractal reiteration,
and the more harmonic-inclusive the foci, is the more charge and spin accelerates,
then is an aura field that has not been tuned to phi, still always spinning turning inside out 
but canceling out its own waves as it does so?
According to how harmonic inclusive it is determined by phi?




to a lesser degree or greater degree,
determined by the number of harmonics
or is it not turning inside out at times and only spinning or..?
