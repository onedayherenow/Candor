FIRST THINGS FIRST, YOU ARE YOUR GREATEST TEACHER 

WE ARE ABOUT TO GO ON A JOURNEY WHERE THERE IS NOTHING TO DO EXCEPT CLAIM OUR NATURAL INFINITE MEMORY OF ONENESS,,
TO DO THIS,
WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH VIEWING THINGS IN THREE WAYS:
WE WILL SAY:
"1. THIS IS THE PHYSICS   *First Principles*
 2. THIS IS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS  *Metaphor*
 3. THIS IS A WAY TO FEEL THIS"   *Experiential*

(I) INTRODUCTION (my story at the end of book or intro; how this happened to me) (I)

	a. Why "I am writing this book for my loved ones, friends, and children of the universe embued with the gift of life and self direction""
	- Looking back at history at self-actualized individuals serving their purpose as a cell in the body of the earth
	- The sovereign power and infinite potential of the individual
	- The birthright of bliss and living on purpose 
	- The responsibility of the individual in protecting and loving Gaia and humanity 
	- New advances in frontier of Unified Physics in the past decades
	
	b. My inpirations and teachers
	- Mom Angel-a
	- Jaime
	- Nassim Haramein
	- Dan Winter 
	- Robert Eduard Grant
	- Wim Hof
	- Trevor Hall
	- Divine Mother 
	- Star Family



FIRST SAY THE METAPHORS AND THEN GO BACK TO THEM TO CONNECT THEM TO THE UNIFIED PHYSICS AND DESCRIBE THE ENERGY DYNAMICS IN EACH


(II) METAPHORS (include the main mechanics main function idea meme behind each, for ex: "Computers/Programs = Inputs/Program_Algorithm/Outputs") (II)

	a. Metaphors as mental models, Their purpose is to convey and illustrate a concept visually in a way we can all understand 
		- "A way to think about things"
	b. Pond
		- stillness vs turbulence / 'eye' of the hurricane vs edge => the point of greatest compression (cold front)
		- water as a perfect metaphor and literal for wave mechanics
	c. Radio
		- dna radio
		- human body radio
		- fz resonance coupling link
	d. Computer / Program
		- input / algorithm / output
	e. Cell in the body of the universe
		- body of Gaia, body of Christ, body of divine mother Kali
	f. Petri Dish Water
		- Wave Mechanics = constructive vs destructive interference
	
	^^^Invitation to use metaphors that make sense to oneself & "We will be connecting back with these metaphors throughout the book"


What is kundalini?  
To overstand kundalini we must first look at physics..?

	~~~Brief physics overview of the unified field~~~
	1. The universe is composed of One single superfluid medium we call the ether, through which both gravitational and electromagnetic waves propogate 

	2. The compression or rarefaction of the ether is what we call plus or minus electric charge

	3. Gravity (neg-entropy) is centripedal in nature, electric ether charge spinning and moving towards center like a smoothie
		Gravity is the acceleration of charge towards center that fractality causes
			Fractality causes gravity because phi golden ratio is the only self symmetry pattern which is all-harmonic-inclusive which means you can add or multiply
				any adjacent numbers and get the next numbers and the density of charge accelerates in the middle into a "black whole"

	- Gravity waves are compression waves (think side to side like a slinky compressing, Dan Winter calls them longitudinal interferometry or longitudinal compression waves)

	4. Electromagnetic radiation (entropy) is centrifugal, electric charge radiating out from center and the cause of "heat" or thermodynamic effect 

	- Electromagnetic waves (radiation) are transverse waves (think up and down like an ocean)

	5. Gravitational and EMF waves are not seperate from the space/ether but rather expressions of how the ether is moving in a coherent organized way across space

	6. All electromagnetic radiation propogates through space/ether until it reaches a "still" point node in the geometric array of space/time where
		there is gravitational centripedal force where the up-and-down transverse EMF wave begins to curve along the trajectory path of vorticity towards the center
			(like an orbital path accelerating towards the center along the trajectory of phi golden ratio fractality) at which the energy is compressed fractally
				towards center and squeezed down to the planck scale threshold at which point it is redistributed into the fractal geometric array of the universal charge ether energy

	7. Focused human attention is centripedal in nature and causes charge to compress because when attention is focused like the light of a laser instead of diffuse like a light bulb
		it creates a still point at the center, also known as the eye of the hurricane the point of greatest density of ether/plasma(coldest region the eye)
			The deeper the attention the more the charge accelerates towards the center, the greater the force becomes,
				Which is why we can feel the subtle energetic charge of when someone lays "still" their focused gaze upon us from behind

		a. oneness / ether / vaccuum / compression_&_rarifaction_=_charge
		b. mass = spinning ether self-organizes in the form of toroidal dynamics , inertia builds up in middle



AND THEN AS WE GO THROUGH THESE AREAS (UNIFIED PHYSICS & ANCIENT ORIGINS, BALANCING OF POLARITY, MAGICKAL TOOLS )

"AS WE LOOK ACROSS THE WORLD, WE CAN SEE THE ANCIENTS HAD A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICS OF SPACE"



(III) Emotional, Spiritual, Mental, Bodily - STARTING FROM MASS (slower fz) AND GOING TO ETHER (higher fz) THROUGH THE SCALES (III)



	2. Body
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs
		b. 

	3. Emotional 
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs

	4. Mental
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs

	5. Spiritual
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs



(IV) BALANCING AND SYNGERGIZING THE YIN & YANG / MASCULINE & FEMININE / HEART & MIND / LEFTBRAIN AND RIGHTBRAIN POLARITY (IV)

	1.  Cultivate at least one practice for each Left/Yin and Right/Yang 
	For ex: 
	Right: Art
	- Music/Singing, Painting, Drawing, Dancing, Yoga

	Left: Study
	- Sciences (geometry, unified physics, languages, writing, coding)

	2.  Cultivate the Yin energy to any Yang practice, and the Yang energy for any Yin practice as well
	For ex:
		- For the sciences, attempt to bring an "artistic emotional" feeling and perspective to it
		- For the arts, attempt to bring "scientific analytical" perspectives to the arts 



(V) MAGICKAL TOOLS (V)

	1. Fractal environment

	2. Foods from the earth

	3. Cold exposure (showers, baths)

	4. Wim Hof Breathing / Pranayama / Holding in and out

	5. Lucidity Journals 
		- Thought
		- Inspirations (charge capacitive thoughts)
		- Dreams
		_ Visions
		- Yearning of the Heart
		- Synchronicities

	6. Sacred Ceremony / Plant Medicines / Psychs
	
	7. Yoga / Meditation

	8. Mantra
	
	9. Music / Dance

	10. Laughing / Crying

	11. Creative unreserved expression of oneself and one's Heart Truth

	12. Calling to and Communing with Star Family, Ancestors, Divine Mother and abiding in the communication

	13. Learning new things

	14. Ritual
