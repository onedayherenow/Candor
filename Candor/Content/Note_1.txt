-------------------- automatic writing time
 and so here we go and turn into a another time where now what we play is the game of imagination.  The game of endless infinity here now everywhere available to us all within.
 To the singularity we go and turns we go across the ocean in a boat

 
 
Anyone else feel Jupiter's energy as a kind of feminine Mars?   Mars/Action + Receptivity (Love?)

I do not mean Mars' counterpart Venus,
But rather the expression of Martian energy in a feminine way:
"I know theyre confused, but theyre made of Love so I am going to
continue to pour my Love unbounded through them and bring them peace now!,
even if they haven't learned how to fully recieve it yet,
and I am going to bless them now!,
even if they don't acknowledge it,
by making sure all are fruitful in the seeds they sow""
.. such is love in action
"For the birds do not horde"
(Opposite of War: Mars, God of War)


If love could dream,
She'd dream of a thousand petal lotus
One for each dream   


Kylie, 


My heart turns inside out for you


As I experience knowing you deeper
Feeling your essence more and more clearly 
it is one of the greatest gifts ever 
and I could unfold with you on and on ,, 
I love how we naturally help each other's unfoldment of our being, the turning inside out of the heart , 
and being at one with one another,, and how we both have a safe container 
for each other where it's okay to not hold back the rawness and messiness that comes with being
a human evolving, feeling free to stretch out our wings with each other, and checking in with each other along the way.
Every moment with you is sacred because, in your presence, even in sweet silent stillness
it feels like being in touch with an intimate part of my soul, feels like coming home

I know I may be imperfect, but my love is true, pure, real and when it comes to you
I am not afraid to profess my love for you to anyone.
I could sing it on the rooftops.  


Sometimes when I think of you I feel you expand in me like a hot air balloon and melt me like a bonfire's flames growing in an igloo

I close my eyes and see you and I together in this life with our imperfectly perfect divinity 
walking each other both through the valley of shadows and also through the sunlit mountain peaks and everything in between.

I believe in our love,, it is something felt undeniably real and I choose it, I choose to be with you
And I have the peace in knowing that my choice is in my



When I think of life and how I could either do as I've always done and do this alone 
(blessed with having my family, but i am the only black/turquoise feathered duckling),
Or I could do as many others do and do this life with a steady stream of "new" persons 
who leave once things get real,
or 


If love could touch, shed hush your fears and hold you steady
She'd dry your tears and stay until you're ready
Ready to start anew


If love could give, she'd give you her presence,
so with time, you'd live to see the deepest essence of
Her being

If love could speak shed say the things that keep you open,
shed whisper truths that mend the broken hearts
Shed ask you to never part
From her Heart

If love could dream,
She'd dream of a thousand, thousand petaled lotus flowers
Each petal a reminder of her eternal returning
Into the farthest reaches of your being

If love could sing 




Like anything else in the natural world, the path of your evolution is only limited by 
your unwillingness to move with the changing time.

 Obstruction is always a clue that a change in outlook is necessary

 the Obstruction you face is something that can’t be changed until you change the way you approach it
