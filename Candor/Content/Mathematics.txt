In looking at fractal equations,
all fractal equations are taking the logarithmic quotient of another logarithm,
AND
"logarithms are functionally inverse to exponential functions,
that is, they 'undo' exponential functions just like how a cube-ROOT function
undoes a cube ^3 function,,
NOW
Philosophically,
both are functions which approach infinity in two different directions,
the logarithmic function approaching quantum infinity while
the exponential function approaching macro-relativistic infinity
both mirroring each other...
not just on a graph but also in WAVE MECHANICS
That is,
The logarithmic functions are inheritly drawn out centripetally negentropic projections
of the continually progressional state of a system that progresses NATURALLY indefinately
& inversely
The exponential functions are inheritly drawn out centrifugally entropic projections
of the continually progressional state of a system that progresses NATURALLY indefinately
and we can see this for example in how entropic it would be to model a system as being
exponential in that, something which exponentially grows will progressively need equivalently
exponential energy to sustain as it grows in function and volume which leads to unsustainability

So fractal equations are when we divide one negentropic system (that is constructive wave interference)
by another negentropic system to 

RE WRITE ABOVE
LOGARITHMS GROW TO THE MOST OPTIMUM NEGENTROPIC SUSTAINABLE ENERGETIC LEVEL AND EXPONENTIALS GROW INDEFINATELY

LOGARITHM FUNCTIONS ARE MODELING THE SET OF INFORMATION IN ANY GIVEN SYSTEM QUANTITATIVELY  AND ITS
NATURAL PROGRESSION BASED ON IT'S CONTINUAL FEEDBACK-FEEDFORWARD WAVE RESONANCE BASED ON THE INITIAL CONDITIONS
IN THE FORM OF ENERGY VALUES
