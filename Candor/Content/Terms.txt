@.TERMINOLOGY SECTION.@  -Remember to organize Alphabetically

INTRODUCTION:

Everything is a language because everything is a dream and language is how we 
give and make context to the dream, and each dream is like it's own universe, a new language in itself

Every language hinges on its definitions
These terms have been learned in different ways and two of the greatest teachers of mine in learning to understand terms 
from the inside out to where one can both feel see what it means and follow its implications and general life cycle
(A wave has a life cycle or beginning and end, a plant, a star, every biological organism including humans)
"The purpose in defining terms in this section is to have a universal language

"Angel" -

~~
"Angular Momentum" - More accurate term for SPIN (more accurately as in the words angular momentum are describing a very
specific relationship between angles, and force, and this we commonly call "spin")

~~~
"Black (W)hole" - Black holes, or 'Black Wholes' as phonetically reflect the wholeness that is  by Nassim Haramein, 

~~~
"Capacitance | Capacitor" - Capacitance of a system is the ability of a system to preserve/retain/store heat | 
"The capacity of a system to not lose it's charge to entropy" Also called 'dielectric permittivity'. (See Dielectric Constant)

~~~
"Centrifugal" - In centrifugal systems, energy in the form of waves are diverging away from center while spinning outwards from the 
vortex, like how, in a silly example we can imagine and remember being kids in the playground at the merry-go-round, and remember
how, as one of the big kids spun the merry go round faster and faster, unless we were standing in the very middle we would be flung
off the edge by what we call centrifugal force diverging away from center. 
Centrifugal force can also be thought of as explosive force.

~~~
"Centripetal" - In centripetal systems, energy in the form of waves are converging towards center while spinning forming a vortex,
like water going down a drain.  
Centripedal system store inertia or momentum like how, the faster you apply centripetal force in the form of: spinning a top, 
the longer it can spin for after you let go of the top because that force is momentum, stored inertia.
Centripetal force can also be thought of as implosive force.

***NOTE: Most all systems in the universe have both centripedal AND centrifugal forces are the SAME TIME,
The ratio however of centripedal to centrifugal is going to depend on the fractality of a system, the more fractal and symmetric
self embeddable, the greater centripedal force, and the greater asymmetry is the greater the centrifugal force is.  


~~~
"Charge" - A region of space where there is greater compression of the space (think of a slinky compressing or compressing a
natural fabric balled up into a bunch so that that area has greater total area/volume of FOLDED PACKED SPACE) 
(Think of how as water freezes aka temperature drops aka molecules become closer and closer together more and more compressed so 
that now that bowl of water has frozen compressed into a tightly packed denser form, so the greater the density of any region of 
space the greater the amount of charge in that area)
To answer those who say in the spiritual communities "Well I thought that the more dense, the lower the vibration?"
And to this we say that would not be accurate physics because the higher the frequency, the more waves per cycle,
which means the smaller the waves are, and the smaller the waves are the more densely packed they can all fit embedded within the
longer waves,, to visualize this concretely think of wood.. if we want to fill a bucket as packed as possible with wood,
we will want to grind it up into as fine teeny poweder particles as possible because the smaller the bits the more densely packed
it can all be compressed)


~~~
"Dielectric Constant" - (See capacitance) We measure how much capacitance a material has by measuring it's dielectric
constant, which is the measure of how permissive a material is to store it's electrical energy without losing any energy,
so a measure of it's capacitance.

~~~
"Dimension" -

~~~
"Discrete/Granular"  - Pixelated space in the form of: Planck spheres are the pixels; we are talking at the planck scale
the space is pixelated/packed with spheres that have diameter and radius size of planck


~~~
"Electro-Magnetic-Force | "Electro-Magnetism"  - Electro magnetism can be defined as

~~~
"Entanglement | Einstein-Rosen Bridge" - 

~~~
"Fear" -

~~~
"First/Fundamental Principles" - Fundamental principles are principles which are universally found throughout any criteria 
or context in the the natural universe, formulated using real observable measurable patterns, forms, and 
flow dynamics based on simple relationships naturally found in geometry.  An example of this is a 3D torus shape pattern
found at all scales in nature 



The language to describe these principles must be unambigious and the same for millions of lightyears apart in the universe,
and so we use the fundamental language of geometry, shape, direction of flux/movement/flow 
(ex: centripetal/inwards, centrifugal/outwards), number

What can be fascinating and subject for philosphical speculation in itself, is that these first/fundamental principles
can also be used to describe not only "physical" phenomena in nature with mass such as how black holes behave and stars are born
or how people gain/lose biophysical energy and become well or sick, 
but also mental psychological and emotional processes.  More on this later, but for now we can play with the idea that 
fundamental principles like centripetal and centrifugal can also be translated to philosphical under(over?)standings
such as yin and yang, feminine and masculine, introverted or extroverted, listening and speaking and so on.. Not just
this example of centripetal and centrifugal but every fundamental principle is by definition universally applicable and
translatable to any school of thought, field of study, or physical real world phenomena (as well as spiritual and
mystical phenomena as we shall explore further)


~~~
"Frame of Reference" -

PRINCIPLE: Frame of reference refers to the center of any arbitrary system from which one is 'looking out' and
making one's calculations or observations from and in relation to,

THINK(METAPHOR): 

FEEL(EXPERIENTIALLY): One of the most common example of a frame of reference we tend to assume is that of our human body
system as a whole.  We can also assume another frame of reference say of that of our family as a whole, or that of Gaia,
that of the solar system,,


for example:  The human body is an arbitrary system we tend to

"Inertia & Stored Inertia"
Inertia : Ability to do work
Stored Inertia : the 'ability to do work or cause momentum' which is stored in the system.  

In the body and biological organisms, 
we see the compression of stored inertia in the form of mass by looking at bone density, muscle mass, and fat composition 
(muscle weighs significantly more than fat as it is more dense per cubic volume)
and in the Etheric Light Body,
we can see stored inertia as well in the form of the plasma field that radiates out from the heart and from our solar plexus
and surrounds our body in the form of how dense the Prana, Chi, Mana magnetism is packed in the center, and we experience this.

~~~
"Ionization" - 

~~~
"Information = Energy/Light/Charge" - This equivalence here demonstrates the energetic quality of information in any system

PRINCIPLES: 
The universe is one single fluid medium of plasma, which is made up of or 'quantized' in discrete granular spherical packets
of energy units we call plancks, and all plancks are equivalent to each other in their amount of energy potential, mass and volume.
So now built upon this, information theory is when we represent the quantization of space into plancks as: information, 
where each planck is a 'bit' of information/light/energy.  This is very useful when we are creating mathematical models to describe
relationships in physics, for example: the evolution of any system, as the more information a system has, the more capacity it has
to acquire more information for it has more energy/information to go off of to acquire more information, and the more information
a system has, the more it can do.

THINK: 
Here are some concrete examples with which to think about this: 
	In food, 
you hear people talking about white bread or something like candy being considered "empty" calories.
In information theory terms, what they are saying is that the density of nutritional information is almost null..
As in, when we are looking for vital-pranic-charge-rich foods, we are looking for the most nutritionally dense food,
as that contains the most information  (information in food takes the form of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc)
	In artifical intelligence, 
Any AI software program is created through a process called "machine learning" where we create a "neural-network"
with computer code, programming the ai software to be able to learn/evolve by 'ingesting' information and creating
relationships based on the associations it creates between information it is fed all together into a kind of
information-network we call a neural-network or AI.

FEEL:  
High density information vs. low density information:
The news corporations on television are owned

"Longitudinal Wave" -

~~~
"Love" -

~~~
"Magnetism"

...Imagine/visualize

~~~
"Mass" - Stored Inertia.  Imagine a region of space where all the smaller divisions of space like plancks, atoms and such are
all behaving coherently as one collective whole, and we can visualize this as region of space that is spinning, coming to 
self organize into a torus field that is spinning turning inside out at the same time, with the area of greatest density or
compression being the very center of the spin, "The Eye of the Hurricane".
The more waves that are densely packed in the center of the torus field, the greater the 'stored inertia' is of the system which means
the 'ability to do work or cause momentum' which is stored in the system.  
 
~~~
"Planck" - Planck is 

~~~
"Plasma" - A fluid-like medium of ionized space;  has a syrupy nature and behaves as such; 
We call it a superfluid as, 
when energy/information/light passes/propogates through plasma in the form of waves (see "waves" terminology)
These waves are not seperate from the space but rather made up of this charged space as we see waves in water
are not seperate from the rest of the water around it but an organized expression of the water

~~~
"Phi" -

~~~
"Piezo-Electric" - The word 'Piezo' is of Greek origin for 'push' or 'pressure'.
Piezoelectricity is a quality that some specific materials have (such as quartz/crystals/sediment/minerals) in which 
raw 'mechanical' pressure/force in the form of squeezing and pushing applied to the material
produces electric charge/voltage in the material (and/or in the medium in which the piezo is in , such as water,
or such as piezo iron-powder in liquid mercury as we find in propulsion devices). 

~~~
"Pressure" - Equally translatable to "Charge"; See Charge. 
Pressure is the engineering term, 
Charge is the physics term. 

~~~
"Relaxation" -  Relaxation and Resistance are opposites.  
Relaxation is a surrender into one's spin, resistance is an impedance in one's spin.  
Relaxation and love also are also related in different ways;
If one is relaxed it is easier to tune one's plasma aura field geometry to phi golden ratio harmonic geometry aka Love,
and if one's plasma aura field geometry is tuned to phi golden ratio harmonic
Love and relaxation are different names we give to similar wave mechanics: That is,  

Chapter?
FEEL(EXPERIENTIALLY) - Lets use the concept of relaxation='surrender into one's spin'
and of 'pressure=charge' to see how one gains energy when applying pressure to one's body
in certain areas.  For example, when lying on one's back there is charge or pressure applied
to the area, which causes greater symmetry of pressure throughout a system which allows
for greater charge/prana absorption from one's environment

"Resistance" -

"Resonance" - 

~~~
"Scale" - 


~~~
"Schwarzschild Solution" - Solution to Einstein Field Equations by Karl Schwarzschild that describes black wholes and the gravitational
	field; 
	the solution implies singularities / black wholes;
	gives the Schwarzschild radius; 
	Schwarzschild radius defines a maximum radius for every black whole mass, where everything less than such radius
	with equal mass will create such a black whole;

~~~
"Speed of Light" -

~~~
"Spin" - 

~~~
"Strong-Force" - 

~~~
"SuperFluid" - A fluid of plasma with a syrupy nature that behaves like any medium of water through which waves propogate.
Superfluids are both compressive like squeezing and pushing together a wide slab of clay into a densely packed ball or area, 
as well as expansive

~~~
"Super-Conductivity" - One way to think of super-conductivity and "charge-distribution-efficiency" is in terms of 
embeddability of waves,
that is, when shorter waves are embedded in long waves so they fit/nest just right so that all
the space within the long waves is packed/folded more and more perfectly with short wave harmonics 
(which is perfected when the long waves and short waves are golden ratio multiples of each other)
then the short waves become part and parcel

~~~
"Torus" - As this is one of the fundamental pillar on which this book is written, we
will explore this in high resolution

A torus is the most naturally forming geometry found throughout the universe 

The Topology: 

The reason why celestial objects orbit around an equatorial disc 
(which is a horizontal plane parallel to the equator) is because the laminar flow of plasmic gravity waves 
comes out precisely at the center of the torus faster than lightspeed)
(like planets orbiting around star's equatorial disc or moons orbiting around planet's equatorial disc)
(at (multiples of integer exponents of golden ratio X the speed of light) 
as Mr. Winter has demonstratedly proven)

As this longitudinal gravity wave of plasma is coming out the center, the field of the system (be it a star,
atom, or planet) it is emerging out of is spinning at the same time due to the angular momentum of the 
plasma black whole at the center of the system which is imploding in a golden ratio spiral in a dodecahedral
array. 

1.  Nature generates a torus the same way a hurricane or tornado is created and that is through
gradients of pressure/charge density.  
When a wave meets another wave that is -Significantly- 'hotter'(less dense) or 'colder'(more dense),
the waves push each other upwards(hotter/less dense) and downwards(colder/more dense) forms a 
spinning gradient of pressure between the greatest cold region pushing centripetally downwards 
through the center while the greatest warm region pushes up and outwards centrifugally out the top
of the mouth of the vortex of the torus, all along while the gradient of pressure differences in between
the coldest("black") and hottest("white") waves are all spinning like shades of "grey" inbetween the 
very center and farthest edge of the torus.
As these shades of grey (or 'medium density') waves spin more and more inwards centripetally through 
the mouth of the torus, they accelerate and gain more pressure/charge density and thus become "colder",
until reaching the center of the torus

Said another way, when two or more wave fronts with
a significant enough density/temperature difference 'meet' or cross, 


~~~
"Transverse Wave" -

~~~
"Vector" - A line of direction of propogation of charge

~~~
"Voltage" - Voltage or a volt refers to the amount of charge flowing through any system. 
In electrical engineering Volt is used as a unit of measure


~~~
"Wave" - A wave (can be visualized as a torus like a smoke ring moving through space parallel to it's 
vertical axis, the direction the holes are pointing to |
OR as ocean up and down waves of pressire that travel across water , 
the flux movement of pressure across a fluid like water 
is a propogation of charge/information/energy with properties 
(see both compression waves and transverse waves terms)

~~~
"Wave Interference Patterns | Constructive vs Destructive Interference" - Wave interference patterns are
very simply the images/patterns in the form of geometry that appear when two or more waves cross each 
other in any fluid/super-fluid medium such as water or the vacuum/space/ether

~~~
"Weak-Force" - 

~~~
"Zero-Point-Energy" -
"Spin path to Zero-Point is a phrase that Winter plays with describing what is needed to create a
kind of 'jacobs ladder' that goes to the kingdom of Heaven, except in our example here the kingdom of Heaven is
the Planck Threshold at which information travels faster than the speed of light (we will shed light on how and why later
pun intended)
