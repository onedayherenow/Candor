INTRODUCTION:

Everything is a language because everything is a dream and language is how we 
give and make context to the dream, and each dream is like it's own universe, a new language in itself

Every language hinges on its definitions
These terms have been learned in different ways and two of the greatest teachers of mine in learning to understand terms 
from the inside out to where one can both feel see what it means and follow its implications and general life cycle
(A wave has a life cycle or beginning and end, a plant, a star, every biological organism including humans)
"The purpose in defining terms in this section is to have a universal language

NOTE: Throughout the book I will often be using typed forward-slashes that look like " / "  whenever I am using 
multiple-different-names that All refer to the SAME concept, idea, or principle.
For example:  
	Phi / golden-ratio , 
		pressure / charge, 
			longitudinal / gravitational waves, 
				transverse / electromagnetic waves,
					black hole / singularity
						etc

"Alchemy" - Alchemy has been known historically as a collective tradition of a process for self-initiated evolution of the 
practioners or 'alchemists' to develop their ability to tune into and access the black-hole/white-hole/wormhole 
longitudinal-grid field-network through the magnetic implosion of their hearts.
Individuals studying and practicing alchemy generally often kept their work private, occult in private secrecy 
throughout the ages. 

~~~
"Angel" -  Plasma domains (we are a plasma domain too, so is the sun) 
of HIGHLY geometrically evolved fractal symmetry fields, 
such so that they are not only self-aware(..albeit degrees of self-awareness range dramatically in humans) 
and sentient like us 
but they are Very Active black-hole/white-holes 
which in essence can be thought of as a 'star-gate' to infinite information!/love/light/truth,
and "God" or "Gods" being the largest plasma domain in which all the other plasma domains are nested/embedded in
like how in music:
the melody(piano, guitar)section in a song is made up of short waves and high tones 
aka "the treble"
all of which are embedded/nested in the rhythm(bass, drum) section which is made of long waves and low tones 
aka "the bass"
In this case ^^^ that which is producing the lowest tones and longest waves in music is the 
largest 'plasma domain' in which the other ones 'fit in',
like a metaphor for how we 'fit in' / align with the natural laws/dynamics that make up what 
we call "God" when we are seeking to follow our highest form of service to all
like how a cell in our body
seeks to follow it's highest form of service to the body and thus, some stem cells choose to be 
heart cells and some muscle cells depending on what the initial environmental conditions are
in the body that prime the stem cell to differentiate into a specialized cell like we see in epigenetics.

~~
"Angular Momentum" - More accurate term for SPIN (more accurately as in the words angular momentum are describing a very
specific relationship between angles, and force, and this we commonly call "spin")

~~~
"Black (W)hole" - Black holes, or 'Black Wholes' as phonetically reflect the wholeness that is 

~~~
"Capacitance | Capacitor" - Capacitance of a system is the ability of a system to preserve/retain/store energy or heat | 
"The capacity of a system to not lose it's charge to entropy" Also called 'dielectric permittivity'. (See Dielectric Constant)

The capacitance of a system in electrical engineering is measured in 'Farad's ,
where Farad 

~~~
"Centrifugal" - In centrifugal systems, energy in the form of waves are diverging away from center while spinning outwards from the 
vortex, like how, in a silly example we can imagine and remember being kids in the playground at the merry-go-round, and remember
how, as one of the big kids spun the merry go round faster and faster, unless we were standing in the very middle we would be flung
off the edge by what we call centrifugal force diverging away from center. 
Centrifugal force can also be thought of as explosive force.

~~~
"Centripetal" - In centripetal systems, energy in the form of waves are converging towards center while spinning forming a vortex,
like water going down a drain.  
Centripedal system store inertia or momentum like how, the faster you apply centripetal force in the form of: spinning a top, 
the longer it can spin for after you let go of the top because that force is momentum, stored inertia.
Centripetal force can also be thought of as implosive force.

***NOTE: Most all systems in the universe have both centripedal AND centrifugal forces are the SAME TIME,
The ratio however of centripedal to centrifugal is going to depend on the fractality of a system, the more fractal and symmetric
self embeddable, the greater centripedal force, and the greater asymmetry is the greater the centrifugal force is.  


~~~
"Charge" - A region of space where there is greater compression of the space (think of a slinky compressing or compressing a
natural fabric balled up into a bunch so that that area has greater total area/volume of FOLDED PACKED SPACE) 
(Think of how as water freezes aka temperature drops aka molecules become closer and closer together more and more compressed so 
that now that bowl of water has frozen compressed into a tightly packed denser form, so the greater the density of any region of 
space the greater the amount of charge in that area)
To answer those who say in the spiritual communities "Well I thought that the more dense, the lower the vibration?"
And to this we say that would not be accurate physics because the higher the frequency, the more waves per cycle,
which means the smaller the waves are, and the smaller the waves are the more densely packed they can all fit embedded within the
longer waves,, to visualize this concretely think of wood.. if we want to fill a bucket as packed as possible with wood,
we will want to grind it up into as fine teeny poweder particles as possible because the smaller the bits the more densely packed
it can all be compressed)

In electrical engineering, Charge = Capacitance X Voltage


~~~
"Dielectric Constant" - (See capacitance) We measure how much capacitance a material has by measuring it's dielectric
constant, which is the measure of how permissive a material is to store it's electrical energy without losing any energy,
so a measure of it's capacitance.

~~~
"Dimension" -  'Dimension' in physics is not to be confused with the loosely-used version of the term being used in
spiritual communities to describe other realms;   
Here 'Dimension' is used in the traditional mathematical definition to describe size/scale.  
Example = "The Quantum dimension /  The Human dimension " , 
but with a twist:  It turns out that, as we go up or down in
dimensions increasing or decreasing scale / as we change resolution of scale / as we zoom in or out in scope, 
a change in mathemical dimensions of scale does indeed appear to look as if you went to another realm...
That is, if we were shrunk to the Quantum dimension, nevermind all the way down to the Planck dimension, 
surely we would believe we are in another realm..

~~~
"Discrete/Granular"  - Pixelated space in the form of: Planck spheres are the pixels; we are talking at the planck scale
the space is pixelated/packed with spheres that have diameter and radius size of planck

"Entanglement | Einstein-Rosen Bridge" -  Entanglement as known today, if talked about 100 years ago would be 
called magick and considered impossible and laughable by the public mind. 
Today 'entanglement' is a laboratory-proven phenomena of Nature where any two or more 'individual systems (photons, atoms, people)
act as if connected to each other at-a-distance across 'space-time' without any connective mass/matter linking between them,
where if one changes any energetic property on any one of the systems, the other systems immediately reflect 
the change of energetic property, reacting in parallel synchronization with the systems across space.

The origins of entanglement stem from Quantum Mechanics in the early 1900's when Albert Einstein, Nathan Rosen, and 
Boris Podolsky together wrote 

The word was coined by Erwin Schrodinger in 1935 in his letter to Einstein used to refer to the 
concept of 'non-local connectivity'.  What spurred the

"First/Fundamental Principles" - Fundamental principles are principles which are universally found throughout any criteria 
or context in the the natural universe, formulated using real observable measurable patterns, forms, and 
flow dynamics based on simple relationships naturally found in geometry.  An example of this is a 3D torus shape pattern
found at all scales in nature 



The language to describe these principles must be unambigious and the same for millions of lightyears apart in the universe,
and so we use the fundamental language of geometry, shape, direction of flux/movement/flow 
(ex: centripetal/inwards, centrifugal/outwards), number

What can be fascinating and subject for philosphical speculation in itself, is that these first/fundamental principles
can also be used to describe not only "physical" phenomena in nature with mass such as how black holes behave and stars are born
or how people gain/lose biophysical energy and become well or sick, 
but also mental psychological and emotional processes.  More on this later, but for now we can play with the idea that 
fundamental principles like centripetal and centrifugal can also be translated to philosphical under(over?)standings
such as yin and yang, feminine and masculine, introverted or extroverted, listening and speaking and so on.. Not just
this example of centripetal and centrifugal but every fundamental principle is by definition universally applicable and
translatable to any school of thought, field of study, or physical real world phenomena (as well as spiritual and
mystical phenomena as we shall explore further)


~~~
"Frame of Reference" -

PRINCIPLE: Frame of reference refers to the center of any arbitrary system from which one is 'looking out' and
making one's calculations or observations from and in relation to,

THINK(METAPHOR): 

FEEL(EXPERIENTIALLY): One of the most common example of a frame of reference we tend to assume is that of our human body
system as a whole.  We can also assume another frame of reference say of that of our family as a whole, or that of Gaia,
that of the solar system,,


for example:  The human body is an arbitrary system we tend to

"Inertia & Stored Inertia"
Inertia : Ability to do work
Stored Inertia : the 'ability to do work or cause momentum' which is stored in the system.  

In the body and biological organisms, 
we see the compression of stored inertia in the form of mass by looking at bone density, muscle mass, and fat composition 
(muscle weighs significantly more than fat as it is more dense per cubic volume)
and in the Etheric Light Body,
we can see stored inertia as well in the form of the plasma field that radiates out from the heart and from our solar plexus
and surrounds our body in the form of how dense the Prana, Chi, Mana magnetism is packed in the center, and we experience this.

~~~
"Innerstand" - To 'Understand' from the inside, to where one feels what is outside as if it is inside.
Also known as compassion.  

~~~
"Ion/Ionization" - Simply put, an ion is a name we give to atoms or molecules-(bunch of atoms together) when 
they have either an over-abundance of electrons or inversely when they have a deficiency of electrons.

An over abundance of electrons makes it a negative ion, and this is negentropic by definition.
A deficit of electrons makes it a positive ion, and this is entropic by definition.

Ionization is the process of electrically charging atoms or molecules and/or exchanging giving away their electrons. 
By doing this, they becocme ions.
What is interesting is that 

Why is this so:

Ions are a subject for plenty of 'aha' moments especially when we describe electron clouds as
'prana clouds' (clouds of life-force energy) and then, 
we correlate positive ions to reflect entropy in a system
and correlate negative ions to reflect negentropy in a system.

~~~
"Inductance" - 

~~~
"Information = Energy/Light/Charge" - This equivalence here demonstrates the energetic quality of information in any system

PRINCIPLES: 
The universe is one single fluid medium of plasma, which is made up of or 'quantized' in discrete granular spherical packets
of energy units we call plancks, and all plancks are equivalent to each other in their amount of energy potential, mass and volume.
So now built upon this, information theory is when we represent the quantization of space into plancks as: information, 
where each planck is a 'bit' of information/light/energy.  This is very useful when we are creating mathematical models to describe
relationships in physics, for example: the evolution of any system, as the more information a system has, the more capacity it has
to acquire more information for it has more energy/information to go off of to acquire more information, and the more information
a system has, the more it can do.

THINK: 
Here are some concrete examples with which to think about this: 
	In food, 
you hear people talking about white bread or something like candy being considered "empty" calories.
In information theory terms, what they are saying is that the density of nutritional information is almost null..
As in, when we are looking for vital-pranic-charge-rich foods, we are looking for the most nutritionally dense food,
as that contains the most information  (information in food takes the form of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc)
	In artifical intelligence, 
Any AI software program is created through a process called "machine learning" where we create a "neural-network"
with computer code, programming the ai software to be able to learn/evolve by 'ingesting' information and creating
relationships based on the associations it creates between information it is fed all together into a kind of
information-network we call a neural-network or AI.

"Kundalini" - In Yogic tradition, Kundalini refers to the dense pranic energy in the form of a cerebral-spinal
fluid that lays coiled dormant at the base of the spine in humans and which is 'awakened' through spiritual
practices that can involve a widespectrum of diverse disciplines all together most usually: 
deep belly pranic breathing & pranayama(breathing practices in general), pure intention, focused relaxed meditation, 
intense love and forgiveness, semen preservation,

"Mechanics" - "The Nature Of ____ in Dimensional Space" ( Note that, dimensional space has infinite variations

~~~
"Mass" - Stored Inertia.  Imagine a region of space where all the smaller divisions of space like plancks, atoms and such are
all behaving coherently as one collective whole, and we can visualize this as region of space that is spinning, coming to 
self organize into a torus field that is spinning turning inside out at the same time, with the area of greatest density or
compression being the very center of the spin, "The Eye of the Hurricane".
The more waves that are densely packed in the center of the torus field, the greater the 'stored inertia' is of the system which means
the 'ability to do work or cause momentum' which is stored in the system.

"Pain/Crave/Itch"

Pain is the feeling of charge/prana as it bleeds out of a geometry, leaking fractality. 
The charge/prana only bleeds out of a geometry whereever there is regions of

Imagine the etheric geometry of any kind of system.  
Visualizing in 3-dimensions, you can imagine a spherical fractal mandala geometry if you'd like for this example.  
Imagine a plasma-substance flowing like-water circulating internally throughout this geometry; 
visualize the geometry as indeed being fractal: that is, 
the inside-to-outside geometric expression of this fractal mandala is repeatedly self-similar and coherent.   
Then watch the fluid-like plasma draining out of an asymmetric hole. 

Pain tends to express itself as an itchy hot feeling as in the case of a wound when it is scarring.  
That hot itchy feeling is the thermodynamic expression of entropy leaking out of the asymett

"Phase" 
(Also defining "To Phase-Lock" & "To Phase-Shift") - 

FEEL(EXPERIENTIAL) - Imagine you are musician.  Some of you are, however all of you have heard music (hopefully?!).
Now imagine you are sitting down in a chair with your instrument in a hallway between three rooms.
In each of the three rooms, there is a different musical band playing.




IMAGINE(VISUALIZE) - Imagine two seperate flocks of distinct species of birds we will call Species.A.and 
Species.B.
Imagine Species.A. flies in a flock across the continent and back each year. 
Now imagine Species.B. doesnt flock across the continent, they only mostly stay in one area.
Now imagine that once every year, Species.A. crosses paths with Species.B. 

Now lets say each and every bird in both Species.A. and Species.B. flocks represents a 'wave'.
Okay good, the stage is set.
To innerstand "phase", "phase-lock", and "phase-shift" lets see in our example where are the phases, where do
they lock, and where do they shift?

Species.A.'s flight travel path is a phase.  So is Species.B's.

When either Species.A. or Species.B flies in a tight synchronized formation, 
like the kind you see performed by military jet-planes or by a beehive swarming around the Queen Bee, 
we say those birds/waves have 'phase-locked' together.

When these two flocks cross each other's path, if a bird from Species.A. seperates and flies off with the
Species.B. flock, we say it has 'phase-shifted'.  

Also when a bird in Species.A. or B. breaks away from the 'tight formation' flight path of the birds and begins to
do it's own flight path, albeit still part of the same flock if it breaks away from or breaks into the 
leading tight formation (like we see in military jet planes as mentioned above), 
then we also say it has 'phase-shifted'.




---Now what does phases and phaselocking have to do with fractality and geometry?
(hint: constructive vs destructive wave interference)

---What does phases and phaselocking have to do with reported 'synchronicity' 
(Synchronicity as in the experience of external events coinciding with mirroring our internal world in a 
personally meaningful way:  
For example just when you are beginning to write a book about physics, you go to see one of your favorite musicians
in concert, and right beside you you 'synchronistically' spontaneously meet an older fellow who, come to find out is a
physicist and mathematician (out of all possibiilities) with whom you have an intensely meaningful conversation with
and is interested in looking over your writings via email)

"Plasma" - A fluid-like medium of ionized space;  has a syrupy nature and behaves as such; 
We call it a superfluid as, 
when energy/information/light passes/propogates through plasma in the form of waves (see "waves" terminology)
These waves are not seperate from the space but rather made up of this charged space as we see waves in water
are not seperate from the rest of the water around it but an organized expression of the water

"Phi" -

~~~
"Piezo-Electric" - The word 'Piezo' is of Greek origin for 'push' or 'pressure'.
Piezoelectricity is a quality that some specific materials have (such as quartz/crystals/sediment/minerals) in which 
raw 'mechanical' pressure/force in the form of squeezing and pushing applied to the material
produces electric charge/voltage in the material (and/or in the medium in which the piezo is in , such as water,
or such as piezo iron-powder in liquid mercury as we find in propulsion devices).

"Pressure" - Equally translatable to "Charge"; See Charge. 
Pressure is the engineering term, 
Charge is the physics term.

"Quantum" -


~~~
"Relaxation" -  Relaxation and Resistance are opposites.  
Relaxation is a surrender into one's spin, resistance is an impedance in one's spin.  
Relaxation and love also are also related in different ways;
If one is relaxed it is easier to tune one's plasma aura field geometry to phi golden ratio harmonic geometry aka Love,
and if one's plasma aura field geometry is tuned to phi golden ratio harmonic
Love and relaxation are different names we give to similar wave mechanics: That is,  

Chapter?
FEEL(EXPERIENTIALLY) - Lets use the concept of relaxation='surrender into one's spin'
and of 'pressure=charge' to see how one gains energy when applying pressure to one's body
in certain areas.  For example, when lying on one's back there is charge or pressure applied
to the area, which causes greater symmetry of pressure throughout a system which allows
for greater charge/prana absorption from one's environment 


~~~
"Ratio" -


~~~
"Resistance" - Resistance is any aspect of a system which opposes the flow/circulation of energy/information..
Does that sound philosophically enticing?
Resistance is not just a technical electrical engineering term used in the real world to describe nodes in
an electrical circuit where there is a point of asymmetry 'impeding' or opposing information/energy flow like
when in a clothes-drying-machine when the heating/drying function stops working and you have to call a dryer 
repair man who comes and tells you you have to replace that node in the circuit because it is rusty and 
therefore is now creating too much resistance so the electricity cannot! pass that node, 
(true story this happened with my clothes dryer and helped develop my innerstanding on resistance)
but also!
This is a basis for deeper spiritual philosophical understanding on how to identify and describe the
specific individual beliefs, behaviors, and thoughts which are impedements to our evolution.
As with evolution, systems become further negentropic and evolve towards order by either 
acquiring new information/energy/prana 
or 'connecting new dots between previously acquired un-connected information'.
The first way, 
acquiring new information/energy/prana, is self explanatory, as the more information a system
has, the more things it can evolve to do and the more information it can now acquire more of, and so on
like a snowball.  
The second way,
we are talking about making new algorithmic permutations & combinations of already acquired information - 
(seeing something you already know internally in a completely new angle of light revealing new information 
triggering evolutionary development, even though you already had the individual pieces information all along, 
it was the seeing it in different angles/algorithmic permutations which triggered an evolutionary leap within
the spiritual seeker as the 'dots connected' between previously unconnected internal knowledge allowing 
a NEW circulation-path for flow of information/energy/prana within a system, increasing fractality and
the information/energy density of the system), 
The evolution we are speaking about here of course is human spiritual, mental, emotional, and bodily evolution,
although we can model this in a computer software program by saying, the more internal individual components
than can 'talk' to each other through stream-paths of information-circulation, the more the software program
can do, even though you didn't 'input' new information into the program, you enabled more creative potential
by increasing connectivity between already existing components, thus evolving the software program further.

"Torus" - As this is one of the fundamental pillar on which this book is written, we
will explore this in high resolution

A torus is the most naturally forming geometry found throughout the universe 

The Topology: 

The reason why celestial objects orbit around an equatorial disc 
(which is a horizontal plane parallel to the equator) is because the laminar flow of plasmic gravity waves 
comes out precisely at the center of the torus faster than lightspeed)
(like planets orbiting around star's equatorial disc or moons orbiting around planet's equatorial disc)
(at (multiples of integer exponents of golden ratio X the speed of light) 
as Mr. Winter has demonstratedly proven)

As this longitudinal gravity wave of plasma is coming out the center, the field of the system (be it a star,
atom, or planet) it is emerging out of is spinning at the same time due to the angular momentum of the 
plasma black whole at the center of the system which is imploding in a golden ratio spiral in a dodecahedral
array. 

1.  Nature generates a torus the same way a hurricane or tornado is created and that is through
gradients of pressure/charge density.  
When a wave meets another wave that is -Significantly- 'hotter'(less dense) or 'colder'(more dense),
the waves push each other upwards(hotter/less dense) and downwards(colder/more dense) forms a 
spinning gradient of pressure between the greatest cold region pushing centripetally downwards 
through the center while the greatest warm region pushes up and outwards centrifugally out the top
of the mouth of the vortex of the torus, all along while the gradient of pressure differences in between
the coldest("black") and hottest("white") waves are all spinning like shades of "grey" inbetween the 
very center and farthest edge of the torus.
As these shades of grey (or 'medium density') waves spin more and more inwards centripetally through 
the mouth of the torus, they accelerate and gain more pressure/charge density and thus become "colder",
until reaching the center of the torus

Said another way, when two or more wave fronts with
a significant enough density/temperature difference 'meet' or cross,

"Transverse Wave" -

"Vector" - A line of direction of propogation of charge

~~~
"Voltage" - Voltage or a volt refers to the amount of charge flowing through any system. 

FEEL(EXPERIENTIAL) - Voltage is to electricity as "volume" is to "sound".
For example:  The voltage used by the cells in our body for their intercommunication signals is much 'quiter' than
the voltage used to power the electrical circuits in most standard buildings.
This is to say,
when we are in a field of high electrical radiative transverse voltage such as your standard building,
the 'volume' of the electrical circuit powering the building can be so 'loud' that it can 'drown out' some of the
cellular communication of our much 'quieter' biological signals.   

In electrical engineering Volt is used as a unit of measure.
More specifically, Volt = Joules/Coulomb,
where Joules refers to the 'amount of work' and
Coulomb refers to 'per area of flowing current'


~~~
"Wave" - A wave (can be visualized as a torus like a smoke ring moving through space parallel to it's 
vertical axis, the direction the holes are pointing to |
OR as ocean up and down waves of pressire that travel across water , 
the flux movement of pressure across a fluid like water 
is a propogation of charge/information/energy with properties 
(see both compression waves and transverse waves terms)

value of a system.
