"Sovereign Soul Reprogramming"

Sovereign Reprogramming for Self Actualization of the Soul :
The Science and Art

Oneness Healix Book (Sweet Mother Kali thank you with all my heart and all my being for you and your children of love and truth guiding me in all this and in the perfect title)

Book divided into sections

Start with:
"When I was six I asked my mom: "Mom I can't go to sleep, how do I go to sleep?  And she said: "Breathe deep from your stomache"
And so I did and fell asleep.  20 years later, I am lucid dreaming that my mom was at my bedside talking to me coherently in a way
"

********************************************((( Meditation )))*******************************************************

Q&A
What is meditation?
What is meditation in terms of physics?
What does meditation accomplish or facilitate in terms of physics?
What are some of the different kinds of fundamental meditation practices?

What is meditation?
When we ask this question, many words come to surface and so we will categorize meditation into the following kinds: 
1. TUNING, REGENERATION, CENTERING, PURIFYING, COHERING, REVITALIZATION
	Directed Inward - (Reset tuning ones fz signature spectrum back to natural resonance)

2. Projective, Active 
	Directed Outwards - (Prayer, Visualization/Affirmation, Source/Angelic/Star-Family/Ancestor Transmissions, Forgiveness) 

3. Receptive, Passive, Mindful, (Insightful - Allowing the subconscious to work behind the scenes) 

In meditation, we are intentionally direct our focused attention into a point which creates a 
feedback-feedforward loop of energy/information ("I am aware that I am aware that I am aware") that recursively embeds into itself
which catalyzes the evolutionary progressions and holistic integration of individual-personal intimate understanding and awareness of 
oneself, ones body, conditioned thought patterns, what one values, what moves one's heart


Meditation, the act of directing one's focus to areas

*****************************((( Charge Accretion / Densifying of Plasma )))*******************************************

Q&A
What is the accretion of charge? 
(Information Theory / Evolution of ReCursive System / Coalescing of Prana~Chi due to Fractality/ Densifying~Aura / Centripedal)


How does absorbtion of charge occur?
(Fractalization self-symmetry centripedal implosion)
We can absorb charge in all kinds of ways, and here now we will abstractify these ways into two categories: 
1. Through Space
2. Through Matter/Protons

(SPACE)
Deep Breathing/Pranayama - The breathe is one of the most direct immediate ways in which we can accrete
	

(Matter/Protons)
	We can think of matter or 

How does one accrete charge?

How can one increase or decrease one's accretion of charge?

****************************((( Tuning of the Human Bio-Energetic Auric Plasma Toroidal Field )))**********************

Q&A
What is the Human Bio-Energetic Auric Plasma Toroidal Field
-The human bio-energetic auric plasma toroidal field can be likened to a cymatics experiment:  In cymatics, we have a fluid-like
medium (most commonly water with some colored dye for us to directly see the visualization of wave interferences) inside of a
dish ontop of a subwoofer speaker that is hooked up to a frequency generator (essencially an amplifier for precise frequency transmission)

The tuning of the human auric plasma field is synonymous to how one can alter the geometry in any cymatic experiment.
We simply alter the frequency signature being transmitted through the fluid-like medium (in this case water)

Pure Intention - Pure intention based on first-principles or Love/HeartBased-Motives should be thought of not as a "method of tuning"
in itself, but rather as the "driver" behind the process of tuning.  Here, because of the very nature of pure intention 
as described above, from first principles Pure Intention functions both mechanically and philosophically as a 
centerpiece ingredient in our proccess of tuning.  
	Philosophically : What is the purpose of tuning oneself if one leaves behind pure intention Love/Heart-Motives?  What is left?
		If one has supernatural or even natural vitality, what good is this to the universe if my motives are exclusively self-serving?
			And if one is exclusively self-serving, then what becomes of one's fractal symmetry across the geometric array grid in which
				one is imbedded?  Well one becomes like a cancer cell.  A cancer cell is asymmetric because of it's inability to 
					coherently communicate and exchange/transfer charge to/with the rest of the cells in the body; Whereas a 
						'generally' geometrically self-symmetric/fractal plasma-body might have little to no issue circulating and
							distributing charge/communicating coherently and in equilibrium across and throughout the body, 
								an asymmetric inter-relationship of non-imbeddable waves in the plasma-body results in "impedence"
									or "resistance" building up wherever the asymmetric nodes are and thus manifesting those nodes in
										the body as an area where charge is accumulating or "growing uncontrollably asymmetrically 
											without reference to any of the rest of the body" and we see this as a tumor.  Thinking
												back to the orchestra metaphor, essentially this is a musician in the orchestra who
													plays increasingly louder and louder and louder (growing tumor/growing amplitude) 
														out of key with absolutely no reference or synchronization to the playing of 
															anyone else.

	
	Mechanically:   


(Naked Raw Nature is only Pure Intention)


Imbeddability - When we are tuning our human bio-energetic plasma aura, we are looking to induce greater imbeddability of waves throughout
our aura into one coherent unit of oneness (imagine imbedding all the musicians of an orchestra perfectly to where all of each 
of the musician's part interweaves and imbeds perfectly within each other's in what we call golden ratio fractality or perfect imbeddability)

'Green Language' is a language used to communicate with Angels, as an interface basically, however with the 
capability of imbedded meaning directed to the one using the language, and perhaps the meaning of syntax of
a 'word' can vary depending on it's 'geometry' or 'isotope'.  One of first associations I had with the thought
of this was Aesop Rock's album Float.  Another of course is mathematics, however sound is an integral part of
this language too as each word could be thought of as a frequency expressed as a note and the different 
geometries may be thought of as different 'voices' or 'geometries' of the tone, for example 'a-e-i-o-u' 
may be thought of as 'isotope transitions' of the frequency tone at which it is intoned.
