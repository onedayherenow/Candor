Q&A
I. Meditation
I.a) What is meditation? | What is meditation in terms of physics?
I.b) What does meditation accomplish or facilitate in terms of physics?
I.c) What are some of the different kinds of fundamental meditation practices?


II. Attention
I.a) What is attention? | What is attention in terms of physics?
	aa. Reciever | Transmitter | Will
		- Attention is the bottleneck through which Will acts : anything we 'willfully' 'intend' to recieve (information, energy) 
		must first pass through our attention as an idea-form or a literal-form
		- Our Attention can be defined as the scope of our willful, self-navigated awareness
		- Notice how we use the word scope here, which alludes to a microscope device used metaphorically
		- In the context of 

	ab. Information Stream Gate: Rate of Refresh X Bandwidth x ?Density of Information?

I.b) Why do we care what attention is?
	ba. Gate of conscious experience
		- Ultimately, our attention is the gatekeeper of our experience and nothing comes in to our conscious awareness unless
		it passes in through the attention, therefore if we can influence and direct our attention, then it turns into us influencing
		and directing our experiences (more later about the mix between both the influence of our own individual feed-forward 
		influence and as well the influence of the collective's feedforward, 
		and both in turn subject to the natural feedback from the Quantum Vacuum Space Grid Ether Matrix )

I.c) How do we gain greater control over our attention and what are the different variations of attention? 
(Single Pointed : narrowing bandwidth, Diffuse : expanding bandwidth, Saturation of bandwidth)

I.d)


What is meditation?
When we ask this question, many words come to surface and so we will categorize meditation into the following kinds: 
1. TUNING, REGENERATION, CENTERING, PURIFYING, COHERING, REVITALIZATION
	Directed Inward - (Reset tuning ones fz signature spectrum back to natural resonance)
	*We can think of this as 
	re-charging a cell phone or letting a computer cool down or re-tuning a guitar string*?

2. Projective, Active 
	Directed Outwards - (Prayer, Visualization/Affirmation, Source/Angelic/Star-Family/Ancestor Transmissions, Forgiveness) 

3. Receptive, Passive, Mindful, (Insightful - Allowing the subconscious to work behind the scenes) 

In meditation, we are intentionally direct our focused attention into a point which creates a 
feedback-feedforward loop of energy/information ("I am aware that I am aware that I am aware") that recursively embeds into itself
which catalyzes the evolutionary progressions and holistic integration of individual-personal intimate understanding and awareness of 
oneself, ones body, conditioned thought patterns, what one values, what moves one's heart


Meditation, the act of directing one's focus to areas

*****************************((( Charge Accretion / Densifying of Plasma )))*******************************************

Q&A
I.a.What is the accretion of charge? 
I.b.Why do we want to accrete charge?
I.c.How can one increase or decrease one's rate of accretion of charge?
I.d.How does absorption/accretion of charge occur?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HOW DO WE FEEL THIS EXPERIENTIALLY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Introduction:
We are now going to go into the heart of the matter regarding energy, bio-physical energy that we feel as the force behind 
focused human attention.
So how do we feel this?
As we go about our day, we notice how our energy fluctuates like a line waving up or down on a graph and thus we notice how we have 
less or more energy.    

It's important to notice that this is a feeling very real that is measurable through taking personal assessments of ones own
performance in tasks ranging from something as simple as speaking and thinking coherently fluid, weightlifting

Have you ever seen someone passionately doing something with enthusiastic energy after having just been stumped and stagnating 
just a bit earlier, and when you asked them "what happened?" they say: "Ive been inspired".
Have you ever picked up the phone worried sick (literally) with no energy, then heard good news from the caller that made you FEEL like
suddenly running in circles sprinting while yelling/screaming in joy?
Have you ever had an idea or something happen to you that you so loved and resonated with so deeply in your core so that
everytime you think of the memory of it, you feel as if "charged" with energy?
Have you ever fallen in love, and everytime you think of your beloved you feel as if "charged" with energy?
Have you ever practiced a form of yoga such as meditation or poses and found you feel charged/energized/revitalized by the practice?
Have you ever taken your shoes off in nature and sunk your feet in the grass walking to discover you feel as if charged and revitalized?
Have you ever washed your face with water and noticed you can think slightly clearer/ slightly more focused? 

Have you ever fasted from food...

!
Write about how one can change one's perspective to a traumatic event, by understanding the fundamental first principles involved,
and alter one's internal geometry symmetry/asymmetry so as to cause one to naturally absorb more charge from one's environment
due to greater fractality due to greater geometric phi symmetry congruence integrity in one's plasma aura field bubble, also
called the 'Rainbow Light Body', or as Dan Winter makes a good point to mention, the Egyptian's term for the Ba as opposed to the Ka.

Have you ever woke up still sleepy only to put on some music you love and find you are suddenly pumped?



(Answers)
I.a
	When we say 'Accretion of charge' , we are referring to the acquisition of new influx of vital 'Chi'/'Prana'/'LifeForce'/'Charge' 
into our energy field which we are calling the human plasmic aura.  (The human plasmic aura is that toroidal field radiating outwards
from our heart center, turning inside out while spinning)
I.b
	The electrically measurable human auric field is made up of solely charge, which is compressed plasma; Said another way,
it is space that is more densely packed with fluctuations/vibrations of the space itself, all in a fluid-like way.  
I.c. 
	Absorbtion of charge is enabled and facilitated most readily when we cohere tune and nest our own auric plasma field into
the larger plasma field in which we are nested 
"for example that of Earth 'Gaia', or that of the geographic magnetic field in which one is located 
(Hopefully a location which is free from or has reduced what Dan Winter calls 'electro-smog', which is the
electro-magnetic radiative pollution of transverse waves, like one gets in a typical corporate office with fluorescent lights and wifi)"
Now, 
in basic terms what we are saying is that charge absorption is facilitated when, ourself = the smaller wave, fits in/embeds perfectly
into the longer wave = landscape/earth/geolocation/sun solar system/galaxy.
I.d.
	What does this mean/Why? 
This occurs because, when our smaller wave (in this example, we are the smaller wave) fits in perfectly in the longer wave
(in this example, we can choose an arbitrary larger system as the longer wave; For example: Earth/Gaia), the charge lifeforce which 
circulates throughout the larger field is circulating through us with greater superconductivity : 
'When' and 'If' we embedd into the larger field by becoming a 'node' in that larger field/geometric array/matrix/grid.
So when our smaller wave fits perfectly in the longer wave, 
nesting occurs, 
and our waves can embedd 'constructively' as opposed to 'destructively'.  
The difference is that: constructive wave interference is when any system allows the charge to be preserved in the system, 
as well as to circulate near superconductive states
(all systems are rudimentarilly made up of soley waves of charge, each with a certain frequency and wavelength; 
the frequency and wavelength of the wave determines whether it can embedd constructively or destructively.  
(Hint: Wavelengths which are golden ratio multiples of planck will always embedd constructively)

Accretion of charge occurs gravitationally, that is, 
the wave mechanics for how plasmic charge is attracted to us is identical to
the way in which planets are attracted to and pulled inwards towards the spinning vortex of the sun as is propogates through space.
There is a suction affect that occurs when our plasma field spins in this vorticular manner, absorbing chi prana vital life force
through the north and south poles of our field inward down the throat of the vortex towards center, 
like going towards the center of a black whole.  

Harmonic inclusiveness - The more harmonic inclusive one is, that is the more harmonics are found in one's aura, 
the more axis of spin are found in the 'eye' or foci of our plasma toroidal field, the greater amperage goes into our psycho-kinetic
projection and perception

LOOK AT - "Haramein's Isotropic Vector Matrix "


We can absorb charge in all kinds of ways, and here now we will abstractify these ways into two categories: 
1. Through Space
2. Through Matter/Protons


(SPACE/ETHER)
Deep Breathing/Pranayama - The breathe is one of the most direct immediate ways in which we can accrete charge




(Matter/Protons)
	We can think of matter or protons as an intermediary for chi absorption

****************************((( Bliss Process / Flow State )))****************************************************

BLISS PROCESS
Q&A
I. What is Bliss / What is a flow state? | ...In terms of physics?
Any activity that makes one more Centripedal


II. Ritual in the context of Bliss
- Any kind of ritual that one repeatedly pairs 


BLISS PROCESS/FLOW STATE


(Flow State)
A flow state can be described as a state of embedding -?oneneself recursively into one's activity or non-activity-?
"seemingly seamless" charge distribution efficiency throughout the plasma field 
	of the individual having the flow state, due to the waves (from heart, brain, etc) throughout the individual all coming into 
		"phaselock" (all shorter and longer waves to come into synchronization of oscillation/vibration to where
			the shorter waves embed perfectly into the longer waves, thanks to golden-ratio-tuned-fractality (picture of waves embedding)


HOW DOES ONE ENTER A FLOW STATE? : PRACTICAL TOOLS AND RITUALS

The goal in flowstate is to be in a state of focused, relaxed, timelessness.  


Lets break down the ingredients to a flow state, with essential and non-essentials

#####-------(((Essentials / Pillars)))----------#####: 
.
a. Focusable Attention for duration of practice
	Phone - Airplane Mode Phone/Phone put in different room
	Blocked of Free Time -
	Relaxation -
	All 'tools &or materials' ready for the practice and within easy access

b. Block of free time with no constraints/obligations/interruptions (depending on the flow practice 1-3 hour blocks (for ex: painting))

c. Relaxation 
	-Ties into one's generation and amplification of alpha brainwave produced in the body which are tell-tale signs of trance or 'flow'
	like that when the brainwaves go into alpha when reading a good book or seeing a compelling film or being with your best friend,
	or Lover, how time stands still and slips like sand through our fingers at the same time, time becomes subjectively elastic and 
	malleable, irrelevant, due to the increase in spin vorticity of our aura when in trance (faster we spin through space, the faster we 
	move through time)
	-When in our flow practice, when we catch ourselves suddenly realizing that a good chunk of time has gone by without us noticing 
	or having thought about it in passing, then we are making great progress in the conditioning of flow,
	and if we notice ourselves thinking about time passing by, we gently steer our focus away from our thoughts and back 
	into the flow practice
	-Ties into Heart-Brain coherent phase-locking "unification" of vibrational waves : Synchronization

d. Thoughts
	- This ties into the relaxation.  As we enter deeper into a relaxed focus trance, our thoughts tend to slow down and begin to 
	fade into the background instead of being one's object of focus.  This is the same state we are entering when we practice 
	any kind of meditation or trance activity mentioned above.  
	Let's take painting again for example: 


e. Meditation
	- In April 2014, I went to a Papadosio show at the National Center 
	(main squeeze opened for them and it was my first Squeeze show) 
	and I met an live-painter who had a booth with incredible art named Christopher Morphis.  
	As an aspiring artist whom had never live-painted yet and inspired by his visionary work, 
	naturally I hung out with him a good deal of the show and probed him with friendly questions about art and how he started.  
	I will always remember:  In his late 20's he began practicing yoga after some plant medicine experiences, and then out of it he 
	felt a growing inspiration to paint and make art, and then he said something that always stuck with me which is he said:
	"The key thing to remember is that all art is meditation."
	
	Meditation then, can be thought of as a meta-skill for flow where, cultivating any kind of meditation practice increases
	one's ability to drop into, sustain, and deepen flow, as flow and meditation can be thought of as synonymous. 

	
	Thoughts are as effective in real-time as a switch is, in being able to fan the flames of fire or
	pour water in our fire so these are to be allowed to


f. Purpose - "My Why"
	- Ultimately our reason why, our Purpose, is the driver behind the engine of flow, even if the reason for why is as simple
	as pure enjoyment and Love such as in the case for the activity of, lets say, Dancing 
	- The More Clearer-Defined, Love-Motivated, and Freshly-Revisited-in-our-Consciousness that our "Why" is, the more horsepower 
	and equanimity or empowerement one will have behind the driver's seat of flow

#####-------(((Non-Essentials , 'Flair' -----(But Very helpful!))))-------##### : 
.
a. Genuine interest/inspiration/fire/purpose regarding the object of attention/target

b. Music
	- Instrumental Music and Right Brain Hemisphere activation
	- Music with words that are subconscious (pay attention to message because it will be on repeat)
	- Isochronic/Binaural Tones

c. Essential Oils

d. Plant Medicines

e. Stretching

f. Designated Space/Area

	D. Mentally
	E. Spiritually
	F. Bodily


Here now, 
through the lens of fundamental first principles of physics, 
we take a sincere scientific account of the practice of Yoga to innerstand the following questions:


I.) What is Yoga?

What is Yoga and why is Yoga one of the most ancient sciences still practiced today by humans after thousands of years?

***Note below on 'what is 'science'?'***
(What is science?:  The systematic, repeatable and practical un-bias non-assumed methodology to reliably elicit or predict a
specific verifiable outcome through non-dogmatic means such as experimentation, observation, measurement, and
theoretical fundamental first principles of physics and geometric space 
-all together with a skeptical frame of mind looking open-minded to the evidence at hand when seen in the context of 
first principles of physics and the electrical dynamics that are at play-,
and the study of such methodology and whatever consistent outcome results present themselves after being tested in
diverse circumstance)

I. A. What are the parts that make up Yoga?

	a.)	Breathe:  Circulating new influx of rich Prana into deep tissue and flushing out stale/stagnant CO2
	b.)	Poses:  Geometry expressed through the body, connecting to Oneness Singularity through our body's Balance
	c.)	Attention: Meditative and present, brainwave tuning exercises, directed and held at a point, modified by the breathe
	d.)	Mantras:  Cymatics	
	e.)	Stretch: Resistance, 


Meditation as brainwave lifting exercises. 
Yoga almost the same as meditation except movement allows for greater focus upon the body 

We find the ancient and still modern practice of Yoga to be validated in it's universal historical claims 
in regards to being a discipline for energetically tuning building and purifying the energy/prana 
throughout the body's plasmic bio-aura field 
(that which we may call the subtle-body or rainbow-light-body through which consciousness
propagates in dreams and astral travel), 
along together with the biological 'molecular (physical)' human body we see in the mirror too.

How is this so?
What are we saying?  



III. What is occurring in yoga: 

Energetically(a general description of what is occuring energetically as a whole)

To give a general energetic description of what is occuring energetically as a whole during yoga,
we look at basic properties of energy and their relationship to yogic practice.
The three basic properties of energy we're looking at are:

YOGA BEFORE AND AFTER:
	Energy Level (Total Energy Amount)
	Energy Frequency (Tonal Cymatics) 
	Energy Density (Plasma and Spin-Rate)

First we will look at these three properties Quantitatively, so as to get directly to the point and to 
not encumber the reader from the start or drown out the raw data with the colorful Qualitative details 
(all of which we will get into after first seeing the bare-bones Quantitative view) 

Quantitatively Total energy:

III. A.) 
Energetically as a whole, the practice of Yoga causes a net-gain of energy.  
That is, without one going any further into the careful analysis further below, 
at the end of a standard yoga practice we confidently say that, 
based on fundamental first principles of physics,
practicing Yoga leads to a total net gain, as opposed to a total net loss or neutrality on energy expenditure vs energy gained. 
In simple words, Yoga is a practice for gaining as well as tuning one's energy through ways that harmonize,
complement, and work with the natural dynamics and principles of the Universe.

****************************((( INFINITY VS FINITE SYSTEMS )))**********************

An age old philosophical divide has existed between humans on Earth:
Those humans who insist the universe is Finite and has beginnings and endings,
and those humans on Earth who insist the universe is Infinite with no beginning or endings.

What if we said finite and infinite systems can't exist without each other?  NEED each other?

This section deals with not only resolving the disparity between finite and infinite systems, 
but also geometrically, quantitatively, and analytically illustrating how finite and infinite systems coexist within 
each other all throughout the universe and set the stage for allowing gravitational and dare I say 
Spiritual effects and experiences to continually manifest.

If this is true, where is the finitude in an infinite system and where is infinity in a finite system?

Here is the key:  
There are two kinds of infinities.  Infinitely small, and Infinitely large.

-Infinitely small-
Infinitely small is a value less than '1' that looks like 0.0000000000000000000000000001 (with more zeros)
where our value continues shrinking farther and farther to the right of the decimal place 
as we grow more zeros to the left of the '1'.
Notice that infinitely small will never be a 'zero' value even though it may get close;
As long as there is a 1 at the end it is a 'non-zero' value; 
This non-zero, although infinitely small, value makes all the difference when we talk about Black Holes here in a moment. 


-Infinitely Large-
Infinitely large is a value that continues growing number digits incrementing to the left of the decimal place 
and looks something like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 and on and on bigger and bigger 
and can be written in scientific notation for example as 10 x 10^93 or something of that nature
(Fun review "10 x 10^93 grams per centimeter cubed" is the energy density calculated within a centimeter cubed space of 
the ether/vacuum,,, thats a '1' and 93 zeros to the left of the decimal large,, all in a centimeter cube of space..
as that would be approaching infinitely large 
(in reality it is infinitely large however mathematicians 're-normalized' their equations to get a finite number to 
be able to write about it in the first place)
tapping into that kind of energy would power a whole solar system of colonized planets for millenia...  ).  


In both cases, the word LIMIT is a keyword, as Infinitely small has no limit towards 0,
and
Infinitely large has no limit towards incrementally large, non-zero values


Now that we know about the two kinds of infinities, we can describe how finite systems are embedded within infinite systems
and vice versa how infinite systems are embedded within finite systems,
as well as how this complementary relationship between finitude and infinity defines and allows for the natural formation of 
Black Wholes at all scales.

THINK(IMAGINE):  
Lets start from the finite.  
Think of different 'systems' of life or mass in the universe that are supposedly finite.  
For example:  A human body, a planet, a star, a cell.
A human body has a limited finite size, a planet has a finite size, a star has a finite size.  By finite size we mean
that it is NOT 'Infinitely Large' in scale/size, that is, the size of the radius of the 'system'/object is a finite number,
not infinity.
Now lets remember there are two kinds of infinities.  
Seeing as these systems we picked above for our example like planet, star, human, have a limited radius, we can say they
are finite.


We are choosing these universal examples for their 'limited' size, as, to be finite, a system has to have a LIMIT.
Each of these examples has a definite limit when going towards infinitely large in size,
and this definite limit we can call the 'surface' or 'boundary' or the 'outside perimeter edges' of the system.
Each of these systems though however, as we'll look at now, have NO LIMIT towards INFINITELY SMALL.
That is, infinity is present in the system going, not towards infinitely large, but towards infinitely small!
That is, if we choose any of these 'finite' systems, from within inside of it's boundary,
we can keep 'zooming in' and zooming in smaller and smaller in scale TO INFINITY.   
How do we model or prove this in a way anyone can innerstand this for themselves?

Mr. Haramein does a fantastic geometric proof for this using only circles and triangles (a circle has a finite boundary)
for anyone to grasp and digest this fully in a visually self-evident fundamental way which we will look at shortly 
after first proving this Quantitatively in numeric values that any child or adult can follow below.

THINK(METAPHOR) - Pick a ruler.  Find the '0 inches' or '0 centimeter' value at the very beginning of the ruler.  Good.  
Now find the '1 inch' or '1 centimeter' value.  Good.  Now we are going to call the space in-between '0' and '1' on the 
ruler 'finite'.  We say it is a finite system because it has a beginning at '0' and ends at '1'.
Good.
Now divide it in half.  What do we have?  .5 or 'one half'  good.  
Now divide it in half.  What do we have?  .25 or 'one fourth' good.
Now divide it in half.  What do we have?  .125 or 'one fourth' good.
Now what happens if we divide it in half TO INFINITY?
You guessed it, there is NO LIMIT.
We can divide this finite system an infinite number of times and we will NEVER get a ZERO.  
That is we will ALWAYS have a NON-ZERO.  
Good... so what happens when we add together an INFINITE-SERIES of NON-ZERO values 
within a FINITE SYSTEM that has a FINITE BOUNDARY?
We get the very definition of a Black Whole...

Infinity and Finite are part of One universal dynamic that is the Torus Dynamics that makes up a black whole, 
black wholes being ubiquitous seeds and powerhouses for life throughout the universe at all scales,
as we will continue to see throughout this book in a variety of ways through fundamental principles of nature that, 
Mr. Haramein as well as other independant Ether/Vacuum scientists in the 1980's and 1990's correctly predicted
Black Wholes to be found at the center of every negentropic (ordered/self-organizing/coherent) system such as 
a proton, a planet, mitochondria, a human body, a galaxy...   



To represent any universal system of any size, lets just give it a number '1' and say this system    



using only two simple shapes: the circle and the equilateral triangle,
who's relationships with each other create an infinite fractal within a finite boundary (a circle's edge)
fractals 
  

For many years it was a common mainstream view that these examples are strictly finite, but here now we see that

Pulsar   

That all being said, lets remember now what Mr. Haramein comically brings to light that there exists no such thing in physics 
as a 'closed system'.  That is, there is no 'seperateness' or division between systems 



Nassim Haramein was one of my main teachers in my path to innerstand finite and infinite systems

****************************((( Coherency = Fractality = Negentropy )))*******************************************

Q&A
How do we innerstand the concepts of both coherency and decoherency in physics in a way we can relate to?
What is the link between coherency, fractality, negentropy, and symmetry?
How do we become more coherent?
What happens energetically in a system when it becomes more coherent?
(longitudinal wave interferometry is more greatly enabled allowing greater communication and relationship with
the longitudinal array and the system in which one is embedded in)

Coherency can be thought of as a philosophical adjective as well as a physics concept most related to fractality.

In describing what Coherency is conceptually through the perspective of fundamental principles,
we can say the ceoncept of "what it means to be coherent" is the same questions as "what it means to be fractal":
To have Symmetry all throughout from internally to externally throughout a system.  

The greater the coherency in a system, the greater it's symmetry.
As we shall look at shortly, Symmetry is also related to the concepts of 'order' (being ordered) and 'organization',
which are both intimately tied to 'negentropy' and 'fractality'.

---(Symmetry is also inversely related to Entropy: a system moving towards greater dis-order has less symmetry,
aka greater 'asymmetry' (and asymmetry causes charge/energy to leak in a system) aka greater de-coherency)---

For now lets first look at a simple universal metaphor to conceptually grasp coherency.

THINK(METAPHOR) - The concept of coherency in humans can be posited as a philosphical statement about
the congruency between:  
What people think (thoughts), what people say (words), and what people do (actions).  
When a person's thoughts, words, and actions all are in alignment with each other, we can say
their thoughts words and actions all contain mutual 'Symmetry'. 
That is,
the "subdivisions" that make up a person, in this case their mind, their speech, and the actions they are expressiong 
through their body, 
they all express the same 'patterns' and thus those subdivisions we are calling mind, speech, 
and actions all refer back to the whole system of which they are apart of; 
'when' and 'if' the macro-pattern of the whole system itself 
(the person as a whole; their total energetic-blueprint frequency-signature ) 
is congruent and referred to by the symmetry found within the subdivisions of their micro 'patterns' such as 
in this example mind, speech, and actions
('habits/routines' 'diet' 'environment' all may be considered as subdivisions of a whole system we call
a person's unique energetic-blueprint frequency-signature (also known as 'the Soul')


THINK(METAPHOR) - 
What would be an example of decoherency in a system and, how is decoherency bred from asymmetry?
To innerstand the link between decoherency and asymmetry, 
lets take the philosophical statement above about 
-the coherency of alignment between microsystems of thought, speech, and action, 
all embedded in the macrosystem of a 'human' or 'soul'-
and lets inverse this example into it's opposite expression to say:
Decoherency in an individual can be described as when their thoughts, words, and actions are Asymmetric to each other 
and/or to the energetic-blueprint frequency-signature resonance of their entire macro-self,
that is, 
when there is lacking congruency or any self-evident pattern or self-similarity throughout the layers of the individual,
whether in their thoughts, words, actions, or all together as a whole taken into account.




Now, 
notice how the more coherent a system becomes, that is, the more inner-to-outer symmetry it has throughout
it's entirety, the greater fractality it has therefore the greater centripetal force it has therefore
the faster that the plasma torus field of the system is spinning therefore the more contrast that any asymmetry 
in the system will create in comparison to the the symmetry of the system, and this contrast will 
be apparent in









How does coherency or decoherency occur?
In any system


Notice how thoughtforms are the most ethereal 

when smaller waves are embedded within longer waves to form what we generally call a 'system' 
(a cell, a human, a planet..),
and when the smaller waves in the system, through frequency pattern and symmetry, self refer back to the whole system 
in which they are embedded in and in which they are a part of, 
that is, 
when all parts or components or subdivisions of a system all contain patterns refer back to 
the whole, we recognize what is known as 'pattern'

pattern we can say that there is coherency in the system 

when it behaves in an organized way that we interpret as pattern
pattern may be what we interpret as organization and so, we can say that coherency is similar to pattern 
however in a system coherency also is synonymous with constructive wave interference, which is a nother word for 
neg entropy and so, then we can equivalate
coherency with negentropy that is a system going from disorder to order and the only way it does this 
is when its own waves and these waves we are referring to as subdivisions or the smaller waves that make up 
and that are embedded in the totality of the system. When these waves are interacting with each other when 
different parts of ourselves are interacting with each other in a constructive way we could even say philosophically 
then we can both say that technically neg entropy is occurring or enabled, more efficient, 
occurring more efficient in the system and thus the system is coherent. 

Scientists an accurate description of fundamental principle and so on. We can say the opposite is also true that D coherency. is akin to entropy and all of the opposite polar equal symmetry to that which we have just described is true for neg entropy

************((( Entropy vs Negentropy | Faster vs Slower Spin as Elastic Time | Degree of heat experienced by Asymmetry )))*************************************
Q&A

(1) (Entropy Vs Negentropy)
1.a. How do we define Entropy?

	Entropy is the progression of a system towards increased Dis-Order, that is to say, De-Coherence of a system's functional behavior.
	We can also define Entropy concretely as: 'Asymmetry in a fractal system' .  Lets look at this and think about entropy by using
	concrete real world examples.  
	Lets say we take a fractal system like our human body (Fractal system in that the teeny plancks that make up my body are all nested
	within the atoms, which are nested/embedded within the cells, which are nested/embedded within the organ, nested embedded in the body)
	One more piece of the puzzle full picture is that, the place of asymmetry in any fractal system is where the 
	collective charge/energy/capacitance of the system is leaking in the form of heat/thermodynamics in that area.
	
	
	Therefore, in our 'Entropy = Asymmetry in a fractal system' example, if 
	charge is leaking in the form of heat/thermodynamics'

1.b. How do we define Negentropy?
	
	Negentropy is the progression of a system towards increased Order, increased Organization, increased Connectivity,
	increased capacitance, greater self-symmetry (the inside looks like and follows the same patterns and behavior as the outside, 
	not only philosphically but literally geometrically in the space of the system) which is another word for fractality.

	Thanks to Dan Winter's discoveries and work in recent decades,
	Negentropy is also defined as the nodal-points or 'stops' along the spiraling continuum from the micro/quantum scale 
	to the macro galactic scale where, the wavelengths are equal to (Planck Length X Whole Number Golden Ratio Exponents).
	Basically Planck Length times golden ratio, and then we can get that result and times that by golden ratio again, and
	get that result and do the same thing, on and on always feeding the result back to golden ratio, and as we do this
	it is like going from train station to train station if we always only stop at where there is LIFE, 
	(aka
	coherent self organization in the form of an atom (hydrogen for example), mitochondria, the earth or a star)
	
	as we do this, each time we are multiplying by golden ratio we are increasing wavelength and decreasing frequency,
	(visualize a wave getting longer and longer, and so less waves fit per unit of time as decreasing frequency)


	We find that, coherent evolving life as we know it emerges and self-organizes out of space whenever we find 
	PHI/Golden-Ratio wave geometric relationships in terms of ratios between adjacent wavelengths which, when in
	Golden Ratio allows for perfect nesting emdeddability between waves within waves, 'Perfect Compression'

	



(2) (Faster vs Slower Spin)
2.a. What are the fundamental causes and characteristics of acceleration or de-acceleration of spin?

|THINKING IN METAPHORS USING REAL LIFE EXAMPLES|
To think about this and under(over?)stand spin, we are going to use the real life visual examples of a spinning hurricane
vortex/torus, and compare this example with another example we call 'Water as it spins down the drain'.

Water going down the drain:  
In this example we represent compression and rarefaction, aka cold(more dense) and warm(less dense)
as water (dense) and air (non-dense, expansive).
As water spins down the drain in the form of a vortex/tornado mouth, air is pushed upwards through the center of the mouth out
the vortex.  Also a key component is that, the act of pulling the drain plug creates a 'hole' out the center of the vortex,
and this hole can be thought of as the point of lowest pressure, and can be thought of as an implosive force WHEN there is 
a gradient of pressure in comparison to the high pressure of compressive bodies of water (the more water, the more weight and
compressive force is pushing down the drain, the greater the gradient between the point of lowest pressure (the hole) and
the volume of water, the greater torque or acceleration of SPIN)

	2a.1.  The fundamental causes of acceleration of spin in any toroidal field is an increase in velocity
	and pressure of centripetal force, 
	and this increase in pressure which is compressive force (another word for a force which increases densification) 
	increases the broadness range of the gradience of difference between: 
	the region of greatest plasmic density in the torus (the cold air that is pushing downwards at the edges of the eye
	
	the eye of the hurricane, the foci, the very center of spin, the heart),
	and
	the region of least plasmic density in the torus ()

	The size of the drain hole is also going to be considered directly correlative to amount/degree of spin.
	
	|THINKING IN METAPHORS USING REAL LIFE EXAMPLES|


(3) ('Faster & Slower Spin' and its effects on 'Entropy & Negentropy')
3.a  How does acceleration of spin and turning inside out of universal torus fields of any size affect it's 
rate of Negentropy vs rate of Entropy?
3.a.1. Spin acceleration increases when the wave path is increasingly composed of golden-ratio/phi wave ratio geometric relationships
for this allows inertia to be preserved due to the fractality that golden-ratio enables as Dan Winter has demonstrated

	"The faster our toroid plasma field spins clockwise/counterclockwise while at the same time turning inside/out like a donut where
	the surface facing the inside is moving towards the outside and back again to the inside while spinning,
	and most importantly this spin-rate is directly correlative to our state of centripetal frequency
	as we raise our frequency, 
	as we go more into bliss and implode charge, our toroidal spin increases/accelerates velocity. 

As our toroidal spin increases/accelerates we absorb more and more energy from our environment at a higher rate, 
as opposed to when we are spinning slower""

3.b  How does DE-acceleration of spin and turning inside out of universal torus fields of any size affect it's 
rate of Negentropy vs rate of Entropy?

*****************************((( Regulating Chi Usage/Depletion )))*******************************************

As we know, energy as we have been calling, 'charge' or "chi/mana/prana" as the ancients used to call it, 
is used in, sustains, heals and regulates our body.

VISUALIZATION(IMAGINE) - As a visualization exercise imagine a golden liquid light made up of little bitty particles
of golden glowing effulgence coming in to the body through the crown of the head, as well as coming up into the 
body from the ground through the feet , flowing through and cleansing and tuning the body as it flows down and up 
through the spine towards and into the heart, radiating back outwards from and around the human heart region to all 
extremeties of the body throughout all limbs, encompassing around the circumference of the area filling and surrounding 
the body like a bubble-cocoon of liquid light that gets more intensely gold the closer you get towards the heart-center.


Q&A
	"?What is Charge/Chi used for in the body, and where have I been unwisely or unknowingly been forcing 
prana/chi/vital-life-force-plasma to be depleted in an unecessary or over-used function?"

.Transferring Charge Voltage as Ionic Potentials across Cell Membranes 
(Electrolytes and Trace Minerals as high dielectric conductors in the body)

.Mucus layer of protection produced around internal organs triggered by asymmetric, prana-deficient, low charge/information foods
and substances (dairy, alcohol etc)

.Semen Production

.Euphoria/Sensational-Pleasure
(If one has more increasing densification/compression of Chi coalescing in one's auric plasma field, 
then one has more voltage available to freely flow through the gates of neuro-chemical transmitters associated
with any activity one is engaged in, from eating/tasting food, hearing music, dancing, walking barefoot on grass, etc)

.Attention
 - As we aggregate more and more Chi in the plasmic aura, it adds 'weight' or 'centripedal-force' to one's center of attention,
 and greater gravitational compression in one's scope of focus

 .Food Digestion
 - The digestive fire that breaks down, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste is powered by Chi ; When the digestive system is
 more inactive, Chi that would be normally used for digesting food is free to be used for more healing functions in the body
 like in the case of fasting

****************************((( Tuning of the Human Bio-Energetic Auric Plasma Toroidal Field )))**********************

Q&A
1. What is the Human Bio-Energetic Auric Plasma Toroidal Field  (See TORUS in Terminology)
-The human bio-energetic auric plasma toroidal field can be likened to a cymatics experiment:  In cymatics, we have a fluid-like
medium (most commonly water with some colored dye for us to directly see the visualization of wave interferences) inside of a
dish ontop of a subwoofer speaker that is hooked up to a frequency generator (essencially an amplifier for precise frequency transmission)

The tuning of the human auric plasma field is synonymous to how one can alter the geometry in any cymatic experiment.
We simply alter the frequency signature being transmitted through the fluid-like medium (in this case water)

Pure Intention - Pure intention based on first-principles or Love/HeartBased-Motives should be thought of not as a "method of tuning"
in itself, but rather as the "driver" behind the process of tuning.  Here, because of the very nature of pure intention 
as described above, from first principles Pure Intention functions both mechanically and philosophically as a 
centerpiece ingredient in our proccess of tuning.  
	Philosophically : What is the purpose of tuning oneself if one leaves behind pure intention Love/Heart-Motives?  What is left?
		If one has supernatural or even natural vitality, what good is this to the universe if my motives are exclusively self-serving?
			And if one is exclusively self-serving, then what becomes of one's fractal symmetry across the geometric array grid in which
				one is imbedded?  Well one becomes like a cancer cell.  A cancer cell is asymmetric because of it's inability to 
					coherently communicate and exchange/transfer charge to/with the rest of the cells in the body; Whereas a 
						'generally' geometrically self-symmetric/fractal plasma-body might have little to no issue circulating and
							distributing charge/communicating coherently and in equilibrium across and throughout the body, 
								an asymmetric inter-relationship of non-imbeddable waves in the plasma-body results in "impedence"
									or "resistance" building up wherever the asymmetric nodes are and thus manifesting those nodes in
										the body as an area where charge is accumulating or "growing uncontrollably asymmetrically 
											without reference to any of the rest of the body" and we see this as a tumor.  Thinking
												back to the orchestra metaphor, essentially this is a musician in the orchestra who
													plays increasingly louder and louder and louder (growing tumor/growing amplitude) 
														out of key with absolutely no reference or synchronization to the playing of 
															anyone else.

	
	Mechanically:   


(Naked Raw Nature is only Pure Intention)


Embeddability - When we are tuning our human bio-energetic plasma aura, we are looking to induce greater imbeddability of waves throughout
our aura into one coherent unit of oneness (imagine imbedding all the musicians of an orchestra perfectly to where all of each 
of the musician's part interweaves and imbeds perfectly within each other's in what we call golden ratio fractality or perfect imbeddability)

*******************************************((( Self Awareness | Evolution of a System)))*****************************************

Q&A
I. Self Awareness
	I.a. How do we define self awareness?

II. Evolution
	II.a. How do we define Evolution?
		II.a.a. Information Theory
		II.a.b. Nassim's Rubix Cube
		II.a.c. Machine Learning AI/ Neural Networks


I.a.) Self awareness and fractality are intimately linked.  In a fractal equation as we know, the equation is mathematical function
that represents for example , 
the input to the function is that which we are observing or being aware OF (in this case our 'self' , us as we are),
and the output of the function 

II.a.  Evolution can be thought of and 'innerstood' intimately from fundamental first principles
by using both perceptive tools and real-world-based examples such as Information theory, Neural-Networks, 
Rubix cubes, and Musical Improvisation.


II.a.b. Information Theory and Evolution:  
Our first helpful perceptive model is Information theory. 
Information Thoery is a quantitative approach to the qualitative process of describing energy
as being an equivalence to information.  
Basically, 
the total set of energetic qualities in any system, be it a human, a star, a planet, 
can be described as sets of information;  We say energy = information = energy.
That is,
all particles and waves of energy doubles as both: "The ability to do work" 
AS WELL AS
"an embodiment statement made up of qualitative information that self-describes itself energetically", for example
	Energy Level (Total Energy Amount)
	Energy Frequency (Spin-Rate | Tonal Cymatics : The Visual Picture of Wave Interference Patterns) 
	Energy Density (Density of Compression)

The information of a system as shared above, although measured quantitatively 
(by quantitatively we mean that these properties are initially defined by a number that is associated with it's measurement)
actually speaks qualitative information about the system itself as well 
(by qualitative we mean the non-numeric properties of a system for example:
it's qualities of fractality, symmetry, functions/purpose/role, wave-geometry,
or in personal human examples, joy, sadness, inspiration, nostalgia)

To give a brief conceptual big-picture innerstanding of Information Theory, 
we first start at saying that all energy is also information.
We then say that from this premise, the evolution of a system can be modeled and innerstood by it's total net energy levels, 
which is by definition the system's total informational-'blueprint' 
From the systems total net energy levels, 
through first fundamental principles and definition of energy = "the ability to do work" we follow that:
"The more energy a system has, the greater it's 'ability to do work'."
Next, we follow that, 
"the greater ability to do work a system has, the greater amount/density of energy/information that system can acquire 
and/or generate"
Next we follow that,
"The greater amount of energy/information that a system can acquire and/or generate, 
the greater it's net energy/information levels can be"
And lastly,
"The greater net energy/information levels of a system, the further along it's evolutionary path it is AND,
the greater influence it has on it's environment, the systems in that environment, and the systems which are 
entangled with that system." 

Is this beginning to have philosophical and spiritual implications?  Okay great we are getting somewhere.  

The atom is 99.99999999999999% space (only 0.000001% of its volume is what we call a 'proton' / 'nucleus').  
This space is an active superfuid plasma we call the Ether/Space/Quantum Vacuum which, 
as we know is a foaming superfluid sea of highly dense 'information'... highly dense 'energy'... 
Space.  Ether.  The Quantum Vacuum.  Many names for the same substance.

Some of Earth's ancient cultures called this same substance many different names as well.
Plato, along with the ancient Greeks called it 'Aether'.
The ancient cultures of India called it Akasha in the Sanskrit language and considered space as a fifth element, 
which is also where the term 'akashic library' / 'akashic records' comes from.
(akashic library/records is a term in some spiritual/mystical traditions used in the 'prevously thought to be mystical' context of: 
Accessing information from the space (akasha) not available locally or temporally in your current coordinates of space/time;
That is, non-local information transfer aka 'remote-viewing' the military term (one of the later subjects of this book)
As well as, non-temporal information transfer aka pre-cognition or regression to a past 'repressed' event in time) 


THINK(METAPHOR) - Lets conceptually grasp the principle of an all-connective Ether medium further by looking at 
how does new information reach the cells throughout our body? 
All cells are swimming in, flowing in the blood... the blood acts as the ubiquitous medium of the body that connects all things 
and delivers environmental signals and information to the cells.

From information theory we can continue to say that evolution occurs in a system that
diverse environments and experiences,

((( Channeling one's own Frequency Signature | Discerningly Identifying one's own thoughts by their Frequency Signatures)))

Sometimes we may have thoughts pass through our consciousness (into and/or through our energetic torus field) 
which do not originate from within us and which we have either picked up from 
the currents of magnetic-wind-waves that flows through the Ether/Quantum Vacuum or 
from being sent the thought by someone else through the transmission of 'longitudinal interferometry',
aka gravitational waves carrying the broadcasted thought to us.

We can simplify here and say that thoughts travel both on transverse and compression waves,
transverse being the magnetic-wind-waves,
compression waves being the longitudinal gravity waves.

The information of the thought-form itself, whether images or words or sensations or emotions,
is embedded within the carrier wave identical to how frequency modulation in radio waves embeds songs and music 
in the form of short-wave frequencies into the longer-carrier-wave radio frequencies.

The long carrier-wave itself on which the thought is traveling has it's own resonant frequency at which it travels and, 
in the example of gravitational longitudinal interferometry for thought transmission,
only those thoughts from sources outside of ourselves that are 'dialed' into carrier-waves that are 'tuned' 
to the very specific frequency-signature of our consciousness may be 'received' or 'tuned into' 
by our consciousness.

Two things from the 'send point' may be dialed and tuned to be received by the 'receive point'.  
First, the thoughtform itself that will be traveling : "The Message".  
Lastly, the carrier wave itself on which the thoughtform or 'information' is traveling : "The Carrier".

Mechanically:
In the case of unintentionally absorbing/picking up thoughts from the ether, 
our human bio auric field that radiates out from our heart around us is attracting magnetism toward it as 
this, what we are calling our human bio auric field, spins.
These thoughts that may be picked up unintentionally from the ether/space around us, 
as they are riding on waves of magnetism that are behaving in ether/space exactly like gusts of wind do or 
how water under the surface does, 
as some gusts of wind bring real compressed dense walls of information = pressure = charge = information = light. 

These currents of waves of magnetism are very real traveling all around us like rivers and one can measure their
magnetic flux density with a fluxmeter.

As these magnetic fields are moving all around us, 
some carrying foreign thoughts on them and so on, 
this is a strong motivator and inspiration to all of us to be familiar with discerning through our thoughts 
and why we want to become accustomed to recognizing frequencies, frequency patterns, and recognizing frequency signatures 
just like we can recognize blindfolded our beloved's voice and the energetic-presence of our beloved(s) beings 
present in the same room with us (familiar frequency) vs a completely unknown arbitrary person in a room with us
(unfamiliar frequency), 
or our beloved's handwriting, or our beloved's unique style of musical playing, that scent which takes us
right back to a memory, or so on..
because all of these examples are that of one recognizing frequencies through familiarity and emotional connection, 
and because each thought too has a resonant frequency signature that matches it's sender,
whoever sent the thought orginally. 
Each thought that's picked up through the ether has a frequency signature embedded in it which corresponds to the
frequency signature of the original system that radiated that thought outward to begin with.
Therefore,
in learning, playing, and practicing discernment and frequency recognition,
one is simultaneously learning, playing, practicing how to keep one's consciousness clean from undesired outside influence
as well as also practicing 'Channeling your own Frequency'.  

As a note, any information that is streamed out longitudinally as gravity wave is is available at all points. 
However, it helps if the point is right at the center of a black hole.

****************************((( Golden Ratio Scale (powers of phi) vs Octave Scale (powers of 2) )))*******************************


Currently, our major/minor music scale is based on octaves made up of powers of two.  If we have an A note on a piano
that is tuned to 432 hz, then to reach the next sequential 'A' note up or down in pitch/fz in the scale, tone-wise, we either multiply or divide
the hz by 2.  Therefore the steps in the spiral staircase of octaves spiraling up and down to infinity for us currently is based
on duplicity.  We can see that 2 implies polarity and begin to see the dualistic nature expressed in our culture: 
science and religion, man and woman, good and evil, so on...

Now the universe itself has it's own musical scale as well.  What happens when we play music tuned to powers of Phi/golden-ratio?
Well when we look back at our sequence of numbers in our spiraling musical scale, we find the numbers heterodyning!
What does this mean?  We mean that we can both either add or multiply any two adjact numbers and get the next two adjacent numbers
in the sequence: For example, the sequence goes .618, 1, 1.618, 2.618, 4.23, 6.9, 11.08, 17.9, 29
and as we see, we can always add 2 adjacent numbers and get the next increasing value for the next adjacent number, or we can 
multiply 
this heterodyning causes charge to acceletate towards center thanks to the self-symmetric fractality that golden ratio causes

NEW INFORMATION ---->
I have recently learned from Dan Winter that there is one possible geometric array/matrix which scales up and down both in:
Golden Ratio & Octaves, and this corresponding geometry is that of a 'stellated dodecahedron icosahedron' (dodeca-icosa),
or as Winter calls his geometric model, the Star-Mother Kit.

'Green Language' is a language used to communicate with Angels, as an interface basically, however with the 
capability of imbedded meaning directed to the one using the language, and perhaps the meaning of syntax of
a 'word' can vary depending on it's 'geometry' or 'isotope'.  One of first associations I had with the thought
of this was Aesop Rock's album Float.  Another of course is mathematics, however sound is an integral part of
this language too as each word could be thought of as a frequency expressed as a note and the different 
geometries may be thought of as different 'voices' or 'geometries' of the tone, for example 'a-e-i-o-u' 
may be thought of as 'isotope transitions' of the frequency tone at which it is intoned.

Most definately 
"Is Space-Time fractal and quantum coherent at the golden mean?"

By golden mean as you know they are referring to golden ratio AKA Phi or 1.618, (related to fibonacci series which is defined by golden mean)
and to break it down more simply,

by quantum coherence they are referring to for example, When a plug is pulled in a bathtub and water is going down the drain as a vortex, 
in that region, the the molecules are all behaving 
"coherently" = "all co-moving as ONE unit/ all the 'parts' perfectly embedd within one another seamlessly to produce a 'Single' Field"
One can say the cells in our body are (generally) coherent as they intercommunicate and behave all as One. 

By fractal spacetime they are referring to how, not only is 'Matter/Mass' fractal = 
geometrically self-symmetric repeating pattern of relationships recursively self-embedding with itself across all scales from the 
teeny quantum to the relativistic large celestial objects. 
(think of protons perfectly coherently embedded in an atom, embedded in a molecule, body, planet, solarsystem, galaxy, uni-verse )
But also, space itself at the quantum level is "granular", "pixelated" or "tiled like a bathroom floor" by spherical units we call "Planck"
These plancks perfectly embedd within all of space fractally and we can see how this occurs visually by looking at the following grid.
We see first, how all the spherical units embedd within each other at golden ratio relationships to one another to produce what the 
ancients called "The Flower of Life"..
And now, very exciting is if we get the centerpoint of every embedded planck sphere and draw a straght line to each adjacent sphere,
we get a fractal geometric grid called an "isotropic vector matrix", which, out of ALL POSSIBLE GEOMETRIC MATRICES/grids, this is the 
only geometric arrangement that is in perfect equilibrium, meaning that for every vector (line length and direction) there is an
equal and opposite vector, which results in perfect 'cancellation' of all 'constants' 
and so thus like a fish out of water, we do not "feel" infinite space  for it is in perfect equilibrium.

... and this is all possible in golden ratio/phi relationships with one another, which is the only ratio which creates
an infinitely fractal array in which the waves have maximum 'constructive' interference.
For example: Photoynthesis
The frequency signatures in light that induce photosynthesis in plants are pure orange and purple light wavelengths 
(frequency determines color)
And Golden ratio X Planck^136 = frequency signature of purple
And Golden ratio X Planck^137 = frequency signature of orange
In between planck^136 & 137 is the color green, which is spit out by the plants because they do not use that wavelength, 
it is not a whole number exponent integer divisible by planck.
From golden ratio X planck^197 to golden ratio X planck^203 we get the human brainwave harmonics from gamma/beta/alpa/theta/delta as well
And Earth year is exactly golden ratio X planck^241 & right next to it at ^240 is venus year.

So to sum it up the article is about how spacetime behaves coherently at the quantum scale when it is in "golden ratio" tuning,
thanks to the fractality that golden ratio causes
