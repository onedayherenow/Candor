1. TUNING, REGENERATION, CENTERING, PURIFYING, COHERING, REVITALIZATION
	Directed Inward - (Reset tuning ones fz signature spectrum back to natural resonance)

feedback-feedforward loop of energy/information ("I am aware that I am aware that I am aware") that recursively embeds into itself
which catalyzes the evolutionary progressions and holistic integration of individual-personal intimate understanding and awareness of 
oneself, ones body, conditioned thought patterns, what one values, what moves one's heart
