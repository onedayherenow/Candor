********************************************((( Meditation )))*******************************************************

Q&A
I. Meditation
I.a) What is meditation? | What is meditation in terms of physics?
I.b) What does meditation accomplish or facilitate in terms of physics?
I.c) What are some of the different kinds of fundamental meditation practices?


II. Attention
I.a) What is attention? | What is attention in terms of physics?
	aa. Reciever | Transmitter | Will
		- Attention is the bottleneck through which Will acts : anything we 'willfully' 'intend' to recieve (information, energy) 
		must first pass through our attention as an idea-form or a literal-form
		- Our Attention can be defined as the scope of our willful, self-navigated awareness
		- Notice how we use the word scope here, which alludes to a microscope device used metaphorically
		- In the context of 

	ab. Information Stream Gate: Rate of Refresh X Bandwidth x ?Density of Information?

I.b) Why do we care what attention is?
	ba. Gate of conscious experience
		- Ultimately, our attention is the gatekeeper of our experience and nothing comes in to our conscious awareness unless
		it passes in through the attention, therefore if we can influence and direct our attention, then it turns into us influencing
		and directing our experiences (more later about the mix between both the influence of our own individual feed-forward 
		influence and as well the influence of the collective's feedforward, 
		and both in turn subject to the natural feedback from the Quantum Vacuum Space Grid Ether Matrix )

I.c) How do we gain greater control over our attention and what are the different variations of attention? 
(Single Pointed : narrowing bandwidth, Diffuse : expanding bandwidth, Saturation of bandwidth)

I.d)


What is meditation?
When we ask this question, many words come to surface and so we will categorize meditation into the following kinds: 
1. TUNING, REGENERATION, CENTERING, PURIFYING, COHERING, REVITALIZATION
	Directed Inward - (Reset tuning ones fz signature spectrum back to natural resonance)
	*We can think of this as 
	re-charging a cell phone or letting a computer cool down or re-tuning a guitar string*?

2. Projective, Active 
	Directed Outwards - (Prayer, Visualization/Affirmation, Source/Angelic/Star-Family/Ancestor Transmissions, Forgiveness) 

3. Receptive, Passive, Mindful, (Insightful - Allowing the subconscious to work behind the scenes) 

In meditation, we are intentionally direct our focused attention into a point which creates a 
feedback-feedforward loop of energy/information ("I am aware that I am aware that I am aware") that recursively embeds into itself
which catalyzes the evolutionary progressions and holistic integration of individual-personal intimate understanding and awareness of 
oneself, ones body, conditioned thought patterns, what one values, what moves one's heart


Meditation, the act of directing one's focus to areas

*****************************((( Charge Accretion / Densifying of Plasma )))*******************************************

Q&A
What is the accretion of charge? 
How can one increase or decrease one's rate of accretion of charge?
How does absorption/accretion of charge occur?

(Information Theory / Evolution of ReCursive System / Coalescing of Prana~Chi due to Fractality/ Densifying~Aura / Centripedal)
BLISS PROCESS

(Fractalization self-symmetry centripedal implosion)
LOOK AT - "Haramein's Isotropic Vector Matrix "


We can absorb charge in all kinds of ways, and here now we will abstractify these ways into two categories: 
1. Through Space
2. Through Matter/Protons


(SPACE/ETHER)
Deep Breathing/Pranayama - The breathe is one of the most direct immediate ways in which we can accrete charge




(Matter/Protons)
	We can think of matter or protons as an intermediary for chi absorption

****************************((( Bliss Process / Flow State )))****************************************************

BLISS PROCESS
Q&A
I. What is Bliss / What is a flow state? | ...In terms of physics?
Any activity that makes one more Centripedal


II. Ritual in the context of Bliss
- Any kind of ritual that one repeatedly pairs 


BLISS PROCESS/FLOW STATE


(Flow State)
A flow state can be described as a state of embedding -?oneneself recursively into one's activity or non-activity-?
"seemingly seamless" charge distribution efficiency throughout the plasma field 
	of the individual having the flow state, due to the waves (from heart, brain, etc) throughout the individual all coming into 
		"phaselock" (all shorter and longer waves to come into synchronization of oscillation/vibration to where
			the shorter waves embed perfectly into the longer waves, thanks to golden-ratio-tuned-fractality (picture of waves embedding)


HOW DOES ONE ENTER A FLOW STATE? : PRACTICAL TOOLS AND RITUALS

The goal in flowstate is to be in a state of focused, relaxed, timelessness.  


Lets break down the ingredients to a flow state, with essential and non-essentials

#####-------(((Essentials / Pillars)))----------#####: 
.
a. Focusable Attention for duration of practice
	Phone - Airplane Mode Phone/Phone put in different room
	Blocked of Free Time -
	Relaxation -
	All 'tools &or materials' ready for the practice and within easy access

b. Block of free time with no constraints/obligations/interruptions (depending on the flow practice 1-3 hour blocks (for ex: painting))

c. Relaxation 
	-Ties into one's generation and amplification of alpha brainwave produced in the body which are tell-tale signs of trance or 'flow'
	like that when the brainwaves go into alpha when reading a good book or seeing a compelling film or being with your best friend,
	or Lover, how time stands still and slips like sand through our fingers at the same time, time becomes subjectively elastic and 
	malleable, irrelevant, due to the increase in spin vorticity of our aura when in trance (faster we spin through space, the faster we 
	move through time)
	-When in our flow practice, when we catch ourselves suddenly realizing that a good chunk of time has gone by without us noticing 
	or having thought about it in passing, then we are making great progress in the conditioning of flow,
	and if we notice ourselves thinking about time passing by, we gently steer our focus away from our thoughts and back 
	into the flow practice
	-Ties into Heart-Brain coherent phase-locking "unification" of vibrational waves : Synchronization

d. Thoughts
	- This ties into the relaxation.  As we enter deeper into a relaxed focus trance, our thoughts tend to slow down and begin to 
	fade into the background instead of being one's object of focus.  This is the same state we are entering when we practice 
	any kind of meditation or trance activity mentioned above.  
	Let's take painting again for example: 


e. Meditation
	- In April 2014, I went to a Papadosio show at the National Center 
	(main squeeze opened for them and it was my first Squeeze show) 
	and I met an live-painter who had a booth with incredible art named Christopher Morphis.  
	As an aspiring artist whom had never live-painted yet and inspired by his visionary work, 
	naturally I hung out with him a good deal of the show and probed him with friendly questions about art and how he started.  
	I will always remember:  In his late 20's he began practicing yoga after some plant medicine experiences, and then out of it he 
	felt a growing inspiration to paint and make art, and then he said something that always stuck with me which is he said:
	"The key thing to remember is that all art is meditation."
	
	Meditation then, can be thought of as a meta-skill for flow where, cultivating any kind of meditation practice increases
	one's ability to drop into, sustain, and deepen flow, as flow and meditation can be thought of as synonymous. 

	
	Thoughts are as effective in real-time as a switch is, in being able to fan the flames of fire or
	pour water in our fire so these are to be allowed to


f. Purpose - "My Why"
	- Ultimately our reason why, our Purpose, is the driver behind the engine of flow, even if the reason for why is as simple
	as pure enjoyment and Love such as in the case for the activity of, lets say, Dancing 
	- The More Clearer-Defined, Love-Motivated, and Freshly-Revisited-in-our-Consciousness that our "Why" is, the more horsepower 
	and equanimity or empowerement one will have behind the driver's seat of flow

#####-------(((Non-Essentials , 'Flair' -----(But Very helpful!))))-------##### : 
.
a. Genuine interest/inspiration/fire/purpose regarding the object of attention/target

b. Music
	- Instrumental Music and Right Brain Hemisphere activation
	- Music with words that are subconscious (pay attention to message because it will be on repeat)
	- Isochronic/Binaural Tones

c. Essential Oils

d. Plant Medicines

e. Stretching

f. Designated Space/Area

*****************************((( Regulating Chi Usage/Depletion )))*******************************************

As we know, the charge or "chi/mana/prana" as the ancients used to call it, is used in and regulates our body

	""?What is Charge/Chi used for in the body, and where have I been unwisely or unknowingly been forcing chi/vital-life-force-plasma
to be depleted in an unecessary or over-used function?""

.Ionic Potentials of Charge across Cell Membranes (Electrolytes and Trace Minerals as high dielectric conductors in the body)

.Mucus layer of protection produced around internal organs triggered by asymmetric, prana-deficient, low charge/information foods
and substances (dairy, alcohol etc)

.Semen Production

.Euphoria/Sensational-Pleasure
(If one has more increasing densification/compression of Chi coalescing in one's auric plasma field, 
then one has more voltage available to freely flow through the gates of neuro-chemical transmitters associated
with any activity one is engaged in, from eating/tasting food, hearing music, dancing, walking barefoot on grass, etc)

.Attention
 - As we aggregate more and more Chi in the plasmic aura, it adds 'weight' or 'centripedal-force' to one's center of attention,
 and greater gravitational compression in one's scope of focus

 .Food Digestion
 - The digestive fire that breaks down, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste is powered by Chi ; When the digestive system is
 more inactive, Chi that would be normally used for digesting food is free to be used for more healing functions in the body
 like in the case of fasting

 .Information Processing
 - Earplugs (& silence in turn)
 - Blue-Light Filter
 

 .Healing/Repair

****************************((( Tuning of the Human Bio-Energetic Auric Plasma Toroidal Field )))**********************

Q&A
What is the Human Bio-Energetic Auric Plasma Toroidal Field
-The human bio-energetic auric plasma toroidal field can be likened to a cymatics experiment:  In cymatics, we have a fluid-like
medium (most commonly water with some colored dye for us to directly see the visualization of wave interferences) inside of a
dish ontop of a subwoofer speaker that is hooked up to a frequency generator (essencially an amplifier for precise frequency transmission)

The tuning of the human auric plasma field is synonymous to how one can alter the geometry in any cymatic experiment.
We simply alter the frequency signature being transmitted through the fluid-like medium (in this case water)

Pure Intention - Pure intention based on first-principles or Love/HeartBased-Motives should be thought of not as a "method of tuning"
in itself, but rather as the "driver" behind the process of tuning.  Here, because of the very nature of pure intention 
as described above, from first principles Pure Intention functions both mechanically and philosophically as a 
centerpiece ingredient in our proccess of tuning.  
	Philosophically : What is the purpose of tuning oneself if one leaves behind pure intention Love/Heart-Motives?  What is left?
		If one has supernatural or even natural vitality, what good is this to the universe if my motives are exclusively self-serving?
			And if one is exclusively self-serving, then what becomes of one's fractal symmetry across the geometric array grid in which
				one is imbedded?  Well one becomes like a cancer cell.  A cancer cell is asymmetric because of it's inability to 
					coherently communicate and exchange/transfer charge to/with the rest of the cells in the body; Whereas a 
						'generally' geometrically self-symmetric/fractal plasma-body might have little to no issue circulating and
							distributing charge/communicating coherently and in equilibrium across and throughout the body, 
								an asymmetric inter-relationship of non-imbeddable waves in the plasma-body results in "impedence"
									or "resistance" building up wherever the asymmetric nodes are and thus manifesting those nodes in
										the body as an area where charge is accumulating or "growing uncontrollably asymmetrically 
											without reference to any of the rest of the body" and we see this as a tumor.  Thinking
												back to the orchestra metaphor, essentially this is a musician in the orchestra who
													plays increasingly louder and louder and louder (growing tumor/growing amplitude) 
														out of key with absolutely no reference or synchronization to the playing of 
															anyone else.

	
	Mechanically:   


(Naked Raw Nature is only Pure Intention)


Imbeddability - When we are tuning our human bio-energetic plasma aura, we are looking to induce greater imbeddability of waves throughout
our aura into one coherent unit of oneness (imagine imbedding all the musicians of an orchestra perfectly to where all of each 
of the musician's part interweaves and imbeds perfectly within each other's in what we call golden ratio fractality or perfect imbeddability)

Now with Haramein's geometric proof for the infinite fractality of all 
"finite" "bounded" systems, when we define the boundary and then represent 
everything within the "finite" boundary as The Universe, we can begin to see
how self symmetry/self similarity of: the smaller fractal divisions or boundaries
nested within the first largest boundary, allows for inertia/plasma/charge to
distribute across the whole array without losing any charge or "energy" in the
form of heat or "entropy"

'Green Language' is a language used to communicate with Angels, as an interface basically, however with the 
capability of imbedded meaning directed to the one using the language, and perhaps the meaning of syntax of
a 'word' can vary depending on it's 'geometry' or 'isotope'.  One of first associations I had with the thought
of this was Aesop Rock's album Float.  Another of course is mathematics, however sound is an integral part of
this language too as each word could be thought of as a frequency expressed as a note and the different 
geometries may be thought of as different 'voices' or 'geometries' of the tone, for example 'a-e-i-o-u' 
may be thought of as 'isotope transitions' of the frequency tone at which it is intoned.

Most definately 
"Is Space-Time fractal and quantum coherent at the golden mean?"

By golden mean as you know they are referring to golden ratio AKA Phi or 1.618, (related to fibonacci series which is defined by golden mean)
and to break it down more simply,

by quantum coherence they are referring to for example, When a plug is pulled in a bathtub and water is going down the drain as a vortex, 
in that region, the the molecules are all behaving 
"coherently" = "all co-moving as ONE unit/ all the 'parts' perfectly embedd within one another seamlessly to produce a 'Single' Field"
One can say the cells in our body are (generally) coherent as they intercommunicate and behave all as One. 

By fractal spacetime they are referring to how, not only is 'Matter/Mass' fractal = 
geometrically self-symmetric repeating pattern of relationships recursively self-embedding with itself across all scales from the 
teeny quantum to the relativistic large celestial objects. 
(think of protons perfectly coherently embedded in an atom, embedded in a molecule, body, planet, solarsystem, galaxy, uni-verse )
But also, space itself at the quantum level is "granular", "pixelated" or "tiled like a bathroom floor" by spherical units we call "Planck"
These plancks perfectly embedd within all of space fractally and we can see how this occurs visually by looking at the following grid.
We see first, how all the spherical units embedd within each other at golden ratio relationships to one another to produce what the 
ancients called "The Flower of Life"..
And now, very exciting is if we get the centerpoint of every embedded planck sphere and draw a straght line to each adjacent sphere,
we get a fractal geometric grid called an "isotropic vector matrix", which, out of ALL POSSIBLE GEOMETRIC MATRICES/grids, this is the 
only geometric arrangement that is in perfect equilibrium, meaning that for every vector (line length and direction) there is an
equal and opposite vector, which results in perfect 'cancellation' of all 'constants' 
and so thus like a fish out of water, we do not "feel" infinite space  for it is in perfect equilibrium.

... and this is all possible in golden ratio/phi relationships with one another, which is the only ratio which creates
an infinitely fractal array in which the waves have maximum 'constructive' interference.
For example: Photoynthesis
The frequency signatures in light that induce photosynthesis in plants are pure orange and purple light wavelengths 
(frequency determines color)
And Golden ratio X Planck^136 = frequency signature of purple
And Golden ratio X Planck^137 = frequency signature of orange
In between planck^136 & 137 is the color green, which is spit out by the plants because they do not use that wavelength, 
it is not a whole number exponent integer divisible by planck.
From golden ratio X planck^197 to golden ratio X planck^203 we get the human brainwave harmonics from gamma/beta/alpa/theta/delta as well
And Earth year is exactly golden ratio X planck^241 & right next to it at ^240 is venus year.

So to sum it up the article is about how spacetime behaves coherently at the quantum scale when it is in "golden ratio" tuning,
thanks to the fractality that golden ratio causes
