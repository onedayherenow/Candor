Tell me what makes you weary
D                      G
Tell me what lights up your eyes
D                      G
I’ll meet you there in the middle
D                      G
We’ll lay down and harmonize
 
 
D                      G
Tell me what makes you peaceful
D                      G
Tell me what you fantasize
D                      G
I’m taking notes in the moonlight
D                      G
We’ll lay down and harmonize
 
 
D                      G
I’m Awake For, I’m Awake for you

 
 
D                      G
Tell me what keeps you honest
D                      G
Tell me what keeps you inspired
D                      G
I’ll always come in the morning
D                      G
We’ll lay down and harmonize
 
 
D                      G
Tell me what moves you ready
D                      G
Tell me what moves your insides
D                      G
I’ll bring the soul bring the steady
D                      G
We’ll lay down and harmonize
 
 
D                      G
We’ll lay down and harmonize
D                      G
I’m Awake for, I’m Awake for You
