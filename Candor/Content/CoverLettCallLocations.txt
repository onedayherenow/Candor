After reading through your open position ___________, 
I am compelled with electric interest to share about who I am

Why do I do what I do?

I see each new challenge through to the end and choose action over inaction.
I see and work starting from the big architectural picture and then
from there focus in on the details. 
Quality is priority, and so I understand the value of testing: unit tests, automated testing, 
performance testing.
