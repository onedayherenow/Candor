"Sovereign Soul Reprogramming"

Sovereign Reprogramming for Self Actualization of the Soul :
The Science and Art

Oneness Healix Book (Sweet Mother Kali thank you with all my heart and all my being for you and your children of love and truth guiding me in all this and in the perfect title)

Book divided into sections


(I) INTRODUCTION (my story at the end of book or intro; how this happened to me) (I)

	a. Why I am writing this book for my loved ones, friends, and children of the universe embued with the gift of life and self direction
	- Looking back at history at self-actualized individuals serving their purpose as a cell in the body of the earth
	- The sovereign power and infinite potential of the individual
	- The birthright of bliss and living on purpose 
	- The responsibility of the individual in protecting and loving Gaia and humanity 
	- New advances in frontier of Unified Physics in the past decades
	
	b. My inpirations and teachers



(II) METAPHORS (include the main mechanics main function idea meme behind each, for ex: "Computers/Programs = Inputs/Program_Algorithm/Outputs") (II)

	a. Metaphors as mental models, Their purpose is to convey and illustrate a concept visually in a way we can all understand

	b. Pond
		- stillness vs turbulence / 'eye' of the hurricane vs edge => the point of greatest compression (cold front)
		- water as a perfect metaphor and literal 
	c. Radio
	d. Computer / Program
	-
	e. Cell in the body of the universe ("the body of christ")
	e. Invitation to use metaphors that make sense to oneself and "We will be connecting back with these metaphors throughout the book"


(III) Emotional, Spiritual, Mental, Bodily - STARTING FROM MASS AND GOING TO ETHER THROUGH THE SCALES (III)

	1. Brief physics overview of the unified field
		a. oneness / ether / vaccuum / compression_&_rarifaction_=_charge
		b. mass = spinning ether in the form of toroidal dynamics , inertia builds up in middle

	2. Body
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs
		b. 

	3. Emotional 
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs

	4. Mental
		a. inputs / algorithm_programs_beliefs / outputs

	5. Spiritual
