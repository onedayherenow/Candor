So for us here on earth what they will do is they will take representatives from every country, 
they will take members of the animal kingdom the sea kingdom the insect kingdom the wildlife kingdom of everything 
and what they will do is they will take us and transport us in starships to a place where they will in fact hold these ceremonies 
and the planet earth and its representatives with all of its life forms at least several representations will be paraded 
and introduced to these other star nations. This process can take up to a year and then everyone is brought back.
Now what you're going to find out in this process or what the kids, our kids are going to find out in this process is that many of the
life forms we have here they already exist in other star planets and other solar systems, 
many of them were brought here and what happens was they would alter their dna in order to see if they could survive in this ecosystem, 
earth is a very complex ecosystem and a lot of that work was done on uranus and on neptune. 
Now isn't it interesting that these are two water planets that are at the edge of our solar system and that water's never frozen 
in fact seasonally you can see green algae growing on neptune, okay our satellites have seen this and you know NASA 
just doesn't know what to say so they say nothing they just in fact ignore it, so there is life everywhere.

This is limited by how many wave forms can stand on a folded surface, where their rotations (nested) can interfere CONSTRUCTIVELY. 
By inspection it becomes clear, that Golden Ratio optimizes this principle.( Perfect recursive adding and multiplying of waves= perfect charge compression). 
When we inspect how this is done in DNA ( Golden Ratio is the increment of turn, the radius of turn, and the increment of wratchet- see pictures: goldenmean.info/12strands ) 
- we see that using Golden Ratio allows rotations to be superposed constructively

I begin with a little history: One hundred years ago Nikola Tesla was receiving his first
patents on "Apparatus for Producing Electrical Currents of High Frequency and
Potential.” Tesla was the first to utilize a resonant oscillator for the transmission of
high frequency signals. Through the commercial applications of Marconi and others,
this became known as radio. It took an "Act of the U.S. Congress" in 1943 to recognize
Tesla as the true inventor of radio. By the efforts and discoveries of many amateur and
professional experimenters since that time, we may now maintain communications
from any location on the planet. Tremendous changes and developments have occurred
in our communication abilities since those first few experiments by Tesla in his small
New York City laboratory during the early 1890s.
Although Tesla took those first steps toward radio, he did not benefit from its financial
returns because his visions were in other directions. The equipment he constructed and
patented were oriented toward a complete planetary communications system. First,
he built a large experimental facility near Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he
explored natural electromagnetic signals, especially from lightning. He then went on
to transmit high power and large potential electromagnetic signals around the earth,
while utilizing varying versions of what has become known as 'Tesla coils'. Figure (1),
shows Tesla's first patent on a system of transmitting electrical energy. He may have
been the first person to listen to the radio spectrum (Solar Cycle 13) before other
man-made transmissions were initiated. Imagine the middle of the twenty meter band at
the peak of the sunspot cycle with no other man-made activity. What might he have
heard? Later, Tesla went on to begin construction of a much larger version of his
transmitting facility at Shoreham, on Long Island in New York, but for many
reasons it was never completed.
Tesla considered his methods of transmission not 'Hertzian waves', or what we now
refer to as transverse electromagnetic waves (radio), but another type of signal
transmission. He described them as faster-than-light (FTL) longitudinal wave
transmissions. I intend to show that there may be other confirmations to the claims of the
amazing Mr.Tesla. He did state that he had indeed detected signals from the other planets
while performing his experiments at Colorado Springs in 1899! Tesla claimed, " that he
had heard periodic and clear signals of number and order". His method of sensing
was an elevated sphere in a series resonant circuit between the atmosphere and the
earth. In 1921, Marconi also reported that he had detected "interplanetary
communications" while performing tests in the Mediterranean and another experimenter,
David Todd, stated that he had detected extraterrestrial signals while listening in
1924.
DR. SEE
Before we come back to present day researches, let us glance at the writings of
mathematician and astronomer, Dr. Thomas Jefferson Jackson See of Missouri,
whose works include a two volume set on the detection, calculation and mapping of
binary star systems. These he published around the turn of the twentieth century. See
prepared many volumes called the "Wave-Theory, Discovery of the Cause of
Gravitation". From his research, he presented a mathematical picture of waves of
gravity extending throughout space, the nature of gravitational stress, and the cause
of gravity's invisible influence. See's gravity waves, which he showed
mathematically to be different from electromagnetic waves, were not detected at
that time. He sometimes referred to them as "long waves". Dr. T.J.J. See envisioned a
spider-web of wave structure extending along all the radii vectors at all distances,
filling all space, from star to star. Figure (2), shows one of Dr. See's many attempts to
present visually this unseen mechanism of celestial influence. See's classical
mathematics calculations and drawings show a constant bidirectional gravitational
wave-stress and inter-locking, cork screw tension in the aether connecting all bodies
in pairs.
The characteristics of an all embracing aether provided the framework for See's
calculation of the 'Wave Theory of Gravity'. By building on Newton's image of the
aether as a "Vibrating medium that diffused over the universe and penetrated all
matter", he was able to calculate many physical constants, such as its energy, stress,
rigidity, and pressure. See's elastic pressure of aether envisioned a universe filled with
invisible Fourier waves of all possible lengths and traveling in every direction under
balanced symmetry of stress about a vibrating body, such as a planet.
Tesla and See were both outspoken critics of Relativity and the supposed accepted
limit of the speed of light. Consequently, neither were given much consideration in the
expanding Relativity climate of physics theory during that period. Even Albert Einstein
in his first Relativity papers accepted the influence of masses at great distances (or nonlocal influence). The interpretations by many physicists regarding Einstein's
equations of General Relativity do not exclude the possibility of faster-than- light
(FTL) communication.
Most of the physics community of the twentieth century abandoned the concept of
an aether's existence because of two factors---the 1887 Michelson-Morley
experiment, which was unable to detect an aether, and a statement by Albert
Einstein that he need not consider an aether for his Relativity formulas to be usable.
Later in his life, Einstein stated that he could not imagine the transmission of
electromagnetic waves without some form of an aether. This idea of an all pervading
aether has returned to us in recent years in a whole new form.
Following the initial presentation of Quantum theory in 1927, with its many radical
interpretations of reality, it became the task of physicists to reconcile the differences
between it and Relativity. Einstein was among the most prominent critics of the Quantum
Mechanical view-point. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper, called
"the EPR Paradox," examining the Quantum interpretation of a possible
instantaneous communication. Over thirty years later, John Bell, a physicist at the
CERN facility in Switzerland, proposed an experiment to confirm or deny this
instantaneous action at a distance. When the experiments were performed, there
was indisputable evidence of the presence of its reality in nature. Bell's theorem
stated that not only are faster-than-light connections possible, but are necessary for
the Universe to function.
To the present day, Quantum physicists believe that their Quantum Field theory
formulae allow for an instantaneous connection throughout all space and time. They
believe a quantum vacuum, universal, zero-point energy field fills all space. It
becomes the source of all matter, and thus, the primary reality of all of the universe.
Light and gravity are no longer phantom-like waves traveling in empty space, but
are moving through this aetheric continuous energy field. This newest vision
reconfirms the most ancient insight of an all-pervading aether.
EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCIES
About twenty years ago I discovered a paper written by Dr. Robert C. Beck entitled
"E.L.F. (Extreme Low Frequency) Magnetic Communications and Signaling". Mr. Beck
offered suggestions for many applications of these relatively unknown frequencies. The
ELF spectrum is below the 10 KHz. range of internationally regulated frequencies. It is
usually considered to be the spectrum of 3 Hz. to 300 Hz. (VLF-3 to 30 KHz.) (ULF-300
to 3000 Hz.) (ELF-3 to 300 Hz.). See figure (3).The wavelengths in the ELF range are
from 100,000 Km. to 1,000 Km. and the wavelength for the earth's 40,000 Km.
circumference falls within that spread. Quite a large antenna farm might be needed for a
resonant dipole in those bands. Beck suggested that the earth's circumference frequency
could be detected, and he even offered an additional paper with easy to construct circuits
to do so. I have since learned that the prominent human brain-wave signals are within
this same ELF range.
I also discovered that there are other uses for these ELF frequencies. While living in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 1977-78, I became aware of the U.S. Navy's interest in
constructing a large underground antenna array at these ELF frequencies for their
communications with the deep-diving Trident submarines. These frequencies do not
see the earth as an obstruction, but are easily propagated through the whole planet.
A scaled down version of the ELF Project array was constructed for the Navy in
Michigan. Its signals can be easily detected anywhere.
In 1952, physicist W.O. Schumann postulated mathematically that our earth and
ionosphere constitute a cavity wave-guide whose physical constants and magnetic
field oscillate at a resonant frequency identical to the range of human brain-waves.
In 1962, researchers at the then National Bureau of Standards reported the actual
detection and recording of these signals. They closely resemble the
encephalographic recordings from human brain-waves. Beck refers to them as the
"earth brain-waves". Recent years have seen investigation by many researchers into the
possible interconnection between these "Schumann Resonances" of the earth and the
EEG detected human brain-waves.
ON THE DIVIDE
In the early 1980's, I had the opportunity to live on a thousand acre ranch at 8000 feet
above sea level near the continental divide in southwest New Mexico. It was a wonderful
and healthy location, with miles to wander and unobstructed views of the starry heavens.
With such an open and high altitude vista, the old dreams of super antennas began to
invade my thoughts.
At first I installed a simple 40 meter dipole with marvelous success. Curiosity soon
compelled me to connect it to an oscilloscope and observe some of the other
electromagnetic activity in that area. During the summer season, the old scope presented
a vast spectrum of lightning-related signal activity. I constructed a large tunable tank
circuit with a 9 inch by 3 foot inductive coil form and a bank of switched capacitors. I
was then able to selectively tune the incoming signal activity to the oscilloscope. I was
especially interested in the electromagnetic (EM) activity below the VLF frequency
range. I soon went on to construct five (550 feet) Vee beams switched from the center
for improved world-wide ham communications. This was my dream antenna.
I began to notice some very powerful activity in the ELF spectrum while using this
antenna and decided that I might be seeing the Navy's ELF transmitter in Michigan
and the Russian 'woodpecker' transmissions from the Ukraine. If the Navy could use
these frequencies, what might I see in this VLF to ELF spectrum if I also tried an
underground antenna? Putting an antenna underground in the rocky high plateau of New
Mexico seemed an impossible task. I tried just laying it on the surface. A year before I
had purchased a very large reel of wire from the surplus of the Los Alamos Research
Laboratory. With my wife Beth on one side of the reel and me on the other, we walked
directly west and lay the wire on the earth's surface. Upon returning to the lab and
connecting the long wire to the oscilloscope and tank circuit, I was amazed at the
never-before-seen signal activity.
Suddenly I was able to see strong, and often harmonically related, signal activity day and
night throughout the year. These signals came and were picked up by through the
earth this surface antenna. I observed EM activity changing with the time of day---
sunrise, sunset, high noon, even at midnight when the sun was opposite on the earth
from New Mexico. I was seeing lightning activity coming through the earth at all times
of day. The most interesting observation was that the combined lightning signals
created a vast spectrum of harmonically related wave-forms. The earth was alive
with vibration, the sum total of the planetary activity. A short time later we added
three more mile-long wires to allow switching to each cardinal direction.
At about this time, I began regular forty meter radio schedules with Harold Faretto, in
Reno, Nevada. Hal, an employee of a research institute in Reno, shared my technical
interests. We spent hours each week with 'on the air' discussions of experiments or recent
discoveries of ourselves and others. Hal sent me a copy of an article from RF Design on
Near Field Communication. I read and filed it for later use. Near field radiation had
been given little attention in my studies at tech school and at that moment I saw little
need for the information. That would change.
THE ELFS
The earth's natural resonances in the ELF spectrum fall within the range of the
brain-wave spectrum. I became interested in a possible spectrum of frequencies for
the rest of the solar system. By utilizing all of the known available physical
characteristics of size and motion, I calculated many frequencies for each solar system
body. There were many harmonically related frequencies, some of which fall within the
human brain-wave ELF spectrum. Figure (3) shows the brain-wave spectrum and some
of the more prominent solar system frequencies within the same band.
"The Music of the Spheres", an ancient concept of the Universal Song, may be seen
as a reality when considering the motions of the solar system. When the revolutions
and rotations for the planets and their moons are converted to frequencies, there
appear many harmonic relationships. For examples: the Moon's revolution is
harmonically attuned to the three largest moons of Jupiter, which are themselves one
octave separated from each other in their revolutions. Jupiter's rotation is a harmonic of
the Earth, and Pasiphae, the outer moon of Jupiter, is in harmony with the Earth's
revolution. There are many other similar solar system harmonics.
Harold helped me construct a sensitive ELF receiving circuit to be used with a PCoperated spectrum analyzer device. Hal used a more elaborate Hewlett-Packard spectrum
analyzer. Over the period of a number of years we communicated back-and-forth via
radio and the land-line regarding the ever changing ELF activity. We were able to see
simultaneous frequency activity at widely separated areas of the country. Hal and his
colleagues were especially excited by observing some of the lower frequency ELF
signals, which seemed to hold correlation with Earth's seismic activity. They referred to
those signals as geologic frequencies. Other researchers are now considering quite
seriously these ELF frequency relationships as earthquake predictors. Figure (4)
demonstrates the magnitude of the received signals from the ELF and lower in frequency.
Earth is alive with this constant electromagnetic vibration intensity. It supplies a
complex play of oscillating harmonics around and through us each moment of our
lives.
DETECTING GRAVITY WAVES
Let me introduce you to an experimenter who may actually be detecting and utilizing
gravity waves today. For many years physicist Gregory Hodowanec in Newark, NJ has
been detecting what he refers to as monopole gravity waves. These monopole signals,
unlike the usually detected gravity waves, are relatively strong and more easily detected.
Hodowanec says, "that monopole gravity waves have been detected for many years; it's
what we are calling 1/f "noise" signals, flicker or background noise". He refers to his
detected waves as scalar in nature, which means the waves are described in terms of
magnitude alone. An example of a scalar field is the one of temperature. Gravitation
has a scalar aspect. Gregory Hodowanec has developed a number of easily constructed
circuits to utilize and detect these monopole gravity waves.
In Hodowanec's cosmology, the universe is considered to be a finite, spherical,
closed system. Monopole gravity waves propagate any distance in Plank time, which
is about 5.4x10-44 seconds, therefore their effects appear everywhere almost
instantly. These gravity wave signals are the sum total of the background flux of the
universe, similar to the total summation of the earth's lightning signals I observed in New
Mexico. Such signals could be a new window into the universe. They may reveal many
aspects not observable with present-day electromagnetic techniques.
Gregory states that listening to the scalar gravity signals with the audio amplifier can be
quite impressive. Some of the coherent "musical" sounds appear to come from the same
direction of space on a daily basis. According to Hodowanec's theories, scalar-type
radiation fields, as is the gravitation field, might be useful to transmit information
"instantly" everywhere in the universe. At his location of 42 degrees N. Latitude, some
of the detected sounds appear to originate from the Perseus and Auriga regions of our
galaxy when those regions appear at zenith. Some of these signals might be of extraterrestrial intelligence, and thus interest other experimenters in SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) to investigate this possibility. Such communication between
different galactic cultures may not be limited by the long time intervals required by
speed-of-light communication of radio.
CAPACITOR AS SENSOR
Over 150 years ago, the renowned grandfather of electromagnetic experimentation,
Michael Faraday, stated, "I believe that as the inductance is to magnetism, the
capacitor is to gravity". Gregory Hodowanec may have given us the gift of a view of
our communications future. Earth's ever-present gravity field provides the presence of a
scalar gravity field on the plates of a capacitor, causing the molecules of the dielectric to
polarize just as though an external DC voltage were being applied. A schematic of his
scalar gravity-signal detector is shown in figure (5).
The small gravity-impulse current generated across capacitor C1 is coupled to the input
of IC1 for amplification. IC1 functions as a current-to-voltage converter. The
capacitance, C1, and the feedback resistance, R1, are chosen sufficiently high in value so
that input circuit "resonance" is much less than 1 Hz. The detected gravity flux
oscillations are a function of both the sensing capacitance and the feedback relationship,
and will thus have different frequencies for different capacitor and feedback resistor
values. The extra op-amp, IC1-b provides added gain and frequency stability. The gravity
detector may be enclosed within an aluminum box to provide a shield from
electromagnetic interference (EMI). The output may be fed to the input of an oscilloscope
or chart recorder for monitoring. Figure (6) shows a simple audio amplifier that can be
used with the detector to listen to the gravity signals, which sometimes resemble a music
rhythm.
THE COSMIC WINDS
Our next stop on the road to gravity wave communication is with Bill Ramsay, who
was at that time living in South Carolina. Ramsay had also discovered Hodowanec's
intriguing experiments. They stirred his sense of wonder and prompted him to perform
some of the same tests. Bill had been hearing these signals for years during his lifetime of
electronic/radio repair. Could anything good come from this ever-present electronic noise
which is the engineer's menace? One day he thought that noise, or better put,
fluctuation actions of all kinds, are present in everything,--the jitters at the quantum
level, Brownian movements in molecules, universe microwave background, thermal
variations, air movements, fluid movements, the human brain-mind-nervous
system, and much more. This "noise" is fundamental to everything.
Bill became particularly interested in one mode of the detection circuits that Hodowanec
calls "QND" for Quantum Non-Demolition. This mode is reached by adjusting a control
so that the circuit operation hangs at the point of oscillation and awaits the introduction of
a gravity pulse. The result is a slight ringing somewhat like that of a bell being struck,
with discernible variations being created by interactions between the earth's gravity field
and those of other cosmic structures. Ramsay describes it as the sound of dried peas being
dropped against a bell. During some situations there are prolonged 'singings' such as
when a moistened finger is run around the rim of a crystal glass tumbler. Ramsay went on
to construct a series of multiple detectors with each attuned to a slightly different
frequency spectrum, the effect, he says, was 'enchanting'. He describes this as being
like listening to ancient chants while on a space journey. During other monitoring
periods, the sounds resemble that of the ocean calls of humpback whales.
One of Bill's monitoring periods was during the summer solstice on June 21st. He
thought that there might be some unusual 'goings on' at the time that the Ancients
called "The day the sun stands still". And so there were! Many prolonged singings
were heard with one of them at the exact moment of gravity solstice, 8.3 minutes
ahead of the much slower light speed response. Ramsay says that since that day he has
many times observed this leading gravity pulse. He refers to his circuits as the "Cosmic
Winds Device".
Bill's next discovery was what he calls 'Fixed Rate Scanning'. While running some tests
on a Rustrak strip-chart recorder for some other experiments, he thought 'why not try this
on a Hodowanec gravity-wave circuit'? He set up a recorder and allowed it to
continuously run. One morning he was amazed to discover that a beautiful and intricate
pattern had been formed while he slept. This opened a whole new door for Ramsay's
cosmic exploring. In this setup the exact frequency and stability of the generator is
primarily determined by a common component, a capacitor, like Hodowanec was using in
most of his detectors. Michael Faraday strikes again!
Bill Ramsay describes for us this most interesting strip-chart recorder experience,
"The strongest sense of this process is gained by sitting in front of a recorder and
watching as the exposed needle seems 'seized' by some force and guided to exactly
the right place at exactly the right moment to add one more dot to the emerging
pattern. For a one hour long pattern there are 1800 dots, each one put on the chart paper
by the striking action of a spring-loaded bar at exact two second intervals. The needle has
more chances of being in the wrong place than in the right one when the bar snaps it
against the pressure sensitive paper and forms a dot. And since the chart moves in one
direction only, there are no chances to go back to fill in a missed place". Figures (7),(8)
are an example of the 'Fixed Rate Scanning'.
These amazing, very long wavelength patterns seem to represent the frequency
beatings of the sun, the moon, and the planetary motions, all in combinations with
other cosmic influences, which may even be beyond our home star system. Ramsay
says that "These pulses might be providing 'markers' or coherency to the universal
hologram". He has had opportunity to compare simultaneous measurements with other
experimenters, and thus to observe these strong correlation. As Bill sees it, "Each
location on the earth surface detects a portion of the universe--the whole earth acts
as a detector/resonator to the complex total. Earth is a mirror of the universe in the
gravity wave qualities".
EVANESCENT NEAR-FIELD
One day while I was considering this problem of instantaneous communication, it
suddenly occurred to me that we on earth are within the near-field of the wavelength
determined by the earth and moon. This earth-moon signal, around .78 Hz., I have
detected by using ELF sensing equipment. So, beginning with the article that Hal had
sent to me years before, I searched for any information I could find related to near-field
radiation, which was really very little.
The region nearest the antenna or radiating element is known as the evanescent or
reactive near-field. The evanescent component of the EM energy decays in amplitude
very rapidly with distance. This region includes both non-propagating (reactive) and
propagating energy. We are familiar with and utilize the propagating field. The
evanescent region is considered to be within three wavelengths, with the greatest energy
levels within one wavelength. The evanescent near-field seems to have some
characteristics which differ from the radiating near-field and the normally used far-field.
First, it does not maintain the commonly detected 90 degree (orthogonal)
relationship between the E (electric) and the H (magnetic) field components, nor is it
related to the characteristic 377 ohm impedance of free-space. Because of these
differences it is considered a non-propagating energy. However, it is capacitively
detectable, but not by free-space propagation. Evanescent energy can be detected in
near-field measurements as energy with a spatial frequency. Spatial frequency is a
frequency measured in units of distance (cycles/distance) as compared to temporal
frequency, which is measured in units of time (cycles/second). For the evanescent
waves, the phase is independent of distance, so that the phase velocity appears to be
infinite or faster-than-light (FTL). Under these conditions of independence, the
transverse electric from the transverse magnetic, each have a longitudinal component as
well as transverse. In addition, energy is stored in the volume occupied by these
fields.
The description of the evanescent energy as non-propagating or non-radiating seems to
indicate that it is not detectable by established electromagnetic methods. There may be
other methods that we must consider to perceive these energy fields.
I would like to present quotations by and about noted physicist Richard P. Feynman,
from his "Lectures on Gravitation". Feynman thought long and hard about the
fundamental problems of gravitational physics. These lectures represent some of his
viewpoints and insights into gravity and gravitational waves.
Feynman compares electricity and gravity in the statement, "If we compare the
differential equations of motion of particles in electrical and gravitational fields, we
find that the gravitational equation has a qualitatively distinct new feature; not only
the gradients, but also the potentials themselves appear in the equations of motion.
Thus, even though the differential equations for the fields are closely parallel, there
is a distinction in the interpretation. In the case of gravitation the quantum force
comes from the wave function of the universe. The important point is that the
electron-photon interaction of special relativity is separated into a faster-than-light
instantaneous longitudinal polarized non-radiative near-field and a transverse
radiative far-field in every frame of reference". He also states that there is "required
to be a static instantaneous Coulomb potential with its own force field and wave
function, and the uncharged scalar field must be attractive or there would be no
long range Newtonian gravitational force". Feynman also says that he understands
"gravity as both geometry and a field".
MECHANISM OF GRAVITY COMMUNICATION
Now that we have considered the supporting evidence for the existence of an
instantaneous gravity wave communication, let us try to determine the possible
mechanism to begin our experimenting. Clearly, the physics and mathematics allow
for a much faster velocity than light speed. It may not be instantaneous, but many
orders of magnitude faster-than-light. The release of very recent research information by
a group of Russian scientists regarding what they term "torsion fields" suggest a speed
in the order of a billion times the light velocity.
We have looked at the methods of sensing by Hodowanec and Ramsay; these two
researchers are making a great contribution toward our future galactic communication.
Now I would like to make an attempt to pull together all of the information to see if there
might be a usable overview as a base for continuing experimentation.
Each cosmic body---a planet, a moon, or a star---utilizes the spherical shape as its
energy containment. The sphere is an ideal shape for a resonant cavity. The very
nature of the sphere means that it resonates over vast spectrums of frequency. For
example, if we start by considering the earth circumference of approximately 7.5 Hz., as
a fundamental, we may calculate and detect many higher harmonically-related
frequencies. In addition, there are radius frequencies with higher harmonics present.
Harmonic waves in a spherical solid set up a periodic distribution within the inner and
outer spherical cavities. The Van Allen energy belts surrounding the earth also present a
multitude of resonant harmonics at lower frequencies than the circumference 7.5 Hz.
Figure (9) shows some of the earth related frequencies.
The numerous energy belts about the earth act as spherical capacitors, one within
another. These energy field capacitors create highly fluctuating potential gradients,
vertically arrayed at right angles to the earth surface. These large spherical capacitors
longitudinally couple a continuous supply of vibrations from the outer magnetosphere to
the earth surface and within the earth. The many surrounding energy belts act as sensitive
detecting membranes to couple the solar system and galactic information vibrations to the
inner earth fields which we inhabit. In addition, they also transfer the earth's natural
resonances back out into the solar system and galaxy, thus supplying earth's link to the
galaxy.
Let us once again look at the Moon and its mean distance from the Earth. If the distance
of the Earth to the Moon (approximately 385,000 Km.) is considered as a
wavelength, then its frequency will be .78 Hz. The distance changes throughout each
month due to the elliptical orbit, giving a maximum frequency of .83 Hz. and a
minimum of .74 Hz. The higher harmonics of these frequencies may be detected by
ELF sensing instruments. All of these harmonics lie within the human brain-wave
region. Figure (10) shows many of the possible energy belt frequencies. These
frequencies are also within the human biological spectrum.
What might this Earth-Moon-wavelength longitudinal near-field wave of influence
look like? Just imagine it as a long vibrating steel rod extending from and attached
to the Earth on one side, and the Moon on the other. Now compare this with a meter
stick held in your hands. If you tap your finger on one end of the meter stick, the
taps will be instantly felt at the opposite end. There is no transmission time.
Likewise, Earth's multitude of natural resonant vibrations are instant, longitudinally,
coupled to be received at the Moon. Also the Moon sends back her messages. There is no
rate of velocity of the signal transmission, such as the speed of light; all is instantaneous.
The Earth and Moon each modulate the common longitudinal chord with their individual
resonances. Since each body is a multi-resonant sphere, they also share many common
fundamental frequencies and harmonics. See Figure (11).
It should not take a great stretch of your imagination to see how our solar system's everchanging longitudinal chords of influence resonate and interact by coupling all
bodies of the solar system to all other bodies, instantaneously! Figure (12) shows an
example. Each individual system of stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets
instantaneously displays its own unique qualities of vibration influence to the
neighboring star systems and to the galaxy. Figure (13) shows us some of the
frequencies of the other nearby stellar systems. And Figure (14) shows some of the
nearby sun-like stellar systems, which may have similar planetary configurations to our
own solar system.
What are these longitudinal waves and how might they function?






Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized communications model in which each party has the same capabilities and either party can 
initiate a communication session.

Unlike the client-server model, in which the client makes a service request and the server fulfills the request, 
the P2P network model enables each node to function as both a client and server.

P2P systems can provide anonymized routing of network traffic, massive parallel computing environments, 
distributed storage and other functions. Most P2P programs focus on media sharing, 
so P2P mostly associates with software piracy and copyright violation.

P2P applications typically enable users to control many parameters of operation. Some of those parameters are the following:

how many member connections to seek or allow at one time;
which systems to connect or avoid;
which services to offer; and
how many system resources to devote to the network.
Some P2P applications simply connect to some subset of active nodes in the network with little user control.

Use cases for the P2P networking topologies have existed since the days of Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, 
but the advantages of the P2P communications model didn't become obvious to the general public until the late 1990s 
when music-sharing P2P applications, like Napster, appeared. Napster and its successors, such as Gnutella and BitTorrent, 
cut into music and movie industry profits and changed how people thought about acquiring and consuming media.

System administrators tend to discourage the use of P2P applications for a few reasons. 
For one, P2P applications can tie up bandwidth. 
P2P applications can also bypass firewalls and distribute malware, which can possibly expose an administrator's 
organization legally. Network administrators often set up networks to prevent PCs from engaging in P2P side talk.

How P2P networks work
When a user downloads a file, the process is typically as follows: The user opens a web browser, 
visits the appropriate website and downloads the file. In this case, the website acts as a server, 
and the user's computer acts as a client that receives the data. 
This process is like a one-way street where the downloaded file transfers from point A, 
the website, to point B, the user's computer.

If the user downloads the same file through a P2P network, however, the process occurs differently. 
The user has to install P2P software on their computer, which creates a virtual network of P2P application users. 
When the user downloads a file, the file downloads in bits that come from various computers in the network that already have the file.

Simultaneously, data also travels from the user's computer to other computers in the network that ask for it. 
This situation is similar to a two-way street -- the file is like numerous small bits of data that come to the user's computer 
but also leave when requested. In fact, the file transfer load distributes between the peer computers.

P2P network architecture
In a P2P network architecture, each computer has the same responsibilities and capabilities. 
Since there is no server, the computers connect with each other in a workgroup to share files, 
printers and internet access. This architecture is practical for workgroups of 12 or fewer computers.

P2P architectures are common in small home networks or office environments where each PC acts as an independent workstation; 
each computer stores data on its own hard drive but has the ability to share data with other PCs on the network.

Advantages of P2P networks
Some advantages of P2P networks are the following:

P2P networks operate without an expensive server.
Each user manages their own computer, eliminating the need for a network manager.
P2P network configuration occurs via wizards in software.
P2P networks can be set up in homes and small businesses.
P2P networks typically have less network traffic than a client-server network.
Disadvantages of P2P networks
Some disadvantages of P2P networks are the following:

Users can't centrally back up files and folders.
Each computer can access other computers, which slows performance.
Files aren't centrally organized into a specific shared area, but rather stored on individual computers.
Each user must ensure viruses aren't introduced into the network.
There is limited security.
P2P vs. client-server
A P2P network involves two or more computers that share individual resources, such as DVD players, printers and disk drives. 
Each computer acts as both client and server and directly communicates with other computers in the network. 
In a P2P network, all computers on the network can access client devices directly connected to one specific computer on the network. 
The only requirement is a means of connection, such as a Wi-Fi router.

A client-server network involves numerous clients that connect to at least one central server where most applications and data 
are installed. Clients access these resources from the server. 
Client-server networks typically have faster access speeds because of the large number of clients they support.

Clients function as workstations without sharing resources. 
Clients can also upgrade applications and files more easily because only one computer stores files. 
In a client-server network, the server is what handles security, rather than each individual user
