So for us here on earth what they will do is they will take representatives from every country, 
they will take members of the animal kingdom the sea kingdom the insect kingdom the wildlife kingdom of everything 
and what they will do is they will take us and transport us in starships to a place where they will in fact hold these ceremonies 
and the planet earth and its representatives with all of its life forms at least several representations will be paraded 
and introduced to these other star nations. This process can take up to a year and then everyone is brought back.
Now what you're going to find out in this process or what the kids, our kids are going to find out in this process is that many of the
life forms we have here they already exist in other star planets and other solar systems, 
many of them were brought here and what happens was they would alter their dna in order to see if they could survive in this ecosystem, 
earth is a very complex ecosystem and a lot of that work was done on uranus and on neptune. 
Now isn't it interesting that these are two water planets that are at the edge of our solar system and that water's never frozen 
in fact seasonally you can see green algae growing on neptune, okay our satellites have seen this and you know NASA 
just doesn't know what to say so they say nothing they just in fact ignore it, so there is life everywhere.

This is limited by how many wave forms can stand on a folded surface, where their rotations (nested) can interfere CONSTRUCTIVELY. 
By inspection it becomes clear, that Golden Ratio optimizes this principle.( Perfect recursive adding and multiplying of waves= perfect charge compression). 
When we inspect how this is done in DNA ( Golden Ratio is the increment of turn, the radius of turn, and the increment of wratchet- see pictures: goldenmean.info/12strands ) 
- we see that using Golden Ratio allows rotations to be superposed constructively


From saturday to sunday evening is the new moon in Libra,,
Me being curious, I looked at the new moon's chart for the planet geometry in the sky 
that day and I found a beautiful pyramid!
In green lines in the middle you can see the perfect triangle and it's on its side pointing to the right.
And what do we have on the right?  We see a gathering of the moon, sun is the circle with dot, 
venus, and mercury looks like venus but with horns all right by each other like theyre having a picnic

Here we come back to the place of learning and we create anything else we want to at the same time

And so we come to a crosspoint where there are many new ways in which we can synergize our energies into creating something novel and new.
For starters, lets begin with just that, beginningness as one does have with a beginners mind.  The creation of novel life.

Thank you great  mother kali for expressing yourself to me in my heart with your love i thank you with all my heart and with all my being

Maybe your new moon ceremony was you giving your body a good restful loving by giving it what it needed and sleeping

If love could touch, shed hush your fears and hold you steady
She'd dry your tears and stay until you're ready
Ready to start anew

If love could give, she'd give you her presence,
and with it I'd live to see her essence
What Love truly is

If love could dream

If love could
